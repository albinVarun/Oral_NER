        "annotations":"Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder of coagulation that results in deficiency of factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or Factor IX (Hemophilia B) with characteristic linked mode of inheritance, almost exclusively seen in males while females are asymptomatic carriers.The common clinical manifestation in both is prolonged bleeding on trivial trauma, mainly into larger joints or muscles. Life threatening bleeding episodes can result spontaneously or from trauma to the head or internal organs. Replacement of deficient clotting protein, known as Anti Hemophilic Factor (AHF) is the main stay in the treatment of haemophilia. Any Surgical treatment of these patients is to be planned in Institution hospital where comprehensive care is available. The availability of AHF has enabled surgeons to take up surgeries in patients with haemophilia. We discuss PWH with congenital factor VIII deficiency presented with oral squamous cell carcinoma of left side lower jaw with main aim is to provide insight into surgical management and care protocol of these patients.Our purpose was to determine the bleeding risk of obligate and potential carriers, highlight the prophylactic applications before interventions for families and physicians.Forty-six sisters who had at least one family member with hemophilia A or B were included. Laboratory parameters were tested.Bleeding tendency interrogated by a detailed questionnaire.The results were compared with 43 healthy female controls.Mean factor activity levels were significantly lower in sisters than control subjects (p = 0,004). Bleeding score was higher in sisters than controls (p = 0.001). Prolonged bleeding after minor injury was significantly higher in the sisters than control subjects (p = 0.008). Requiring further treatment due to prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction was significantly higher in sisters (p = 0.001). Sisters had postpartum hemorrhage lasting longer than 6 weeks than controls (p = 0.025). Menstrual period lasted longer in the sisters than controls (p < 0.001). Spontaneous epistaxis, oral and gingival bleeding were more frequently observed in sisters whose factor activity levels were 60 % or below (p = 0.014 and p = 0.047, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the severity of hemophilia in the affected family member and the factor levels in the sisters (p = 0.398).Spontaneous epistaxis has found to be significantly associated with the hemophilia severity in the family (p = 0.004).Clotting factor levels were found to be lower in the sisters and associated with spontaneous epistaxis, oral and gingival bleeding.Also, regardless of clotting factor levels, sisters significantly experienced more bleeding problems.Our study demonstrated the importance of taking precautions for prolonged bleeding in cases where medical interventions are inevitable in these patients.Acquired hemophilia A is a rare coagulopathy caused by inhibitors of blood coagulation factor VIII. Patients with acquired hemophilia A have a higher mortality risk (5-10%) than those with congenital hemophilia. Moreover, there is no established evidence of management recommended for patients with acquired hemophilia A. Previous studies have reported the presence of hematomas in the oral cavities of patients with acquired hemophilia A, which were treated conservatively. Here, we describe the case of a patient with acquired hemophilia A, where emergency surgical hemostasis was required for large intraoral hematomas.A 65-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of bleeding from large intraoral hematomas. On examination, he could not close his mouth because of the hematomas, which were bleeding spontaneously. Computed tomography angiography revealed no evidence of arteriovenous malformation, and blood test results showed that the activated partial thromboplastin time was elevated beyond the normal limit. To avoid a life-threatening hemorrhage from hematomas, emergency surgical hemostasis was performed with nasotracheal intubation using fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Hemostasis was successfully performed, as the hematomas were carefully removed. Moreover, the clinical course was successfully completed using intravenously administered activated prothrombin complex concentrate for hemostasis after operation.Acquired hemophilia A can cause a life-threatening hemorrhage without predictive factors. Intraoral hematoma may cause airway obstruction. There is no consensus regarding the management of hemorrhage in patients with acquired hemophilia A. As shown here, exophytic hematomas in the oral cavity can be safely removed and nasotracheal intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be useful in patients with coagulopathy disease.Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is an extremely rare and serious bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Approximately, 10% of patients with AHA have an underlying malignancy. We report on a 46-year-old man with AHA and advanced oral cancer who presented with massive bleeding after surgery. Preoperative blood coagulation tests showed no abnormalities. He underwent radical tumor resection followed by reconstruction using a free rectus abdominal musculocutaneous flap. Massive subcutaneous hemorrhage developed in his neck and abdomen on the first postoperative day. The hemorrhage remained uncontrolled, despite embolization of the responsible vessels. Subsequent laboratory data showed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased FVIII levels. On the basis of his clinical course and the presence of the FVIII inhibitor, we speculated that the patient suffered from AHA. We administered recombinant activated factor VII and prednisolone, after which the spontaneous bleeding stopped and the subcutaneous hemorrhage resolved. A review of the literature identified only three previous documented cases of AHA associated with head and neck cancer. This case indicates that AHA should not be ruled out in patients with uncontrolled postoperative bleeding, while attempting to ensure bleeding control and preventing potentially catastrophic fatal consequences.Primary hemostasis begins with endothelial injury. VWF, produced by endothelial cells, binds to platelets and links them to subendothelial collagen. Platelet-derived ADP and thromboxane activate non-adhered platelets via their GPIIb/IIIa receptors, allowing these platelets to participate in platelet aggregation. Secondary hemostasis is initiated with the binding of factor VII to extravascular tissue factor (TF). Factors II, VII, IX and X are vitamin K-dependent factors. The role of vitamin K is to assist in the addition of gamma carboxylate groups to glutamic acids in the \"GLA\" domains of these factors.In vitro the intrinsic pathway is initiated when fresh whole blood is placed in a glass tube. The negative charge of the glass initiates the \"contact pathway\" where FXII is activated and then FXIa cleaves FIX to FIXa. The extrinsic pathway is triggered when tissue factor, phospholipid and calcium are added to plasma anticoagulated with citrate. In vitro, FVII is activated to FVIIa, and TF-FVIIa preferentially converts FX to FXa activating the common pathway.The prothrombin time is commonly used to monitor warfarin anticoagulant therapy. To correct for differences in reagent and instrument, the international normalized ratio was developed to improve standardization of PT reporting globally. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to evaluate the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. The aPTT is useful clinically as a screening test for inherited and acquired factor deficiencies as well as to monitor unfractionated heparin therapy although the anti-Xa assay is now the preferred measure of the effects of unfractionated heparin. The Clauss assay is the most commonly performed fibrinogen assay and uses diluted plasma where clotting is initiated with a high concentration of reagent thrombin.The mixing study assists in the assessment of an abnormally prolonged PT or aPTT. An equal volume of citrated patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and the PT or aPTT are repeated on the 1:1 mix. Factor activity assays are most commonly performed as a one-stage assay. The patient's citrated plasma is diluted and mixed 1-to-1 with a single factor-deficient substrate plasma. A PT or aPTT is performed on the above mix, depending on the factor being tested.Factor inhibitors are antibodies that are most commonly diagnosed in male patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) where they are induced by factor replacement therapy.Factor inhibitors can also appear in the form of spontaneous autoantibodies in both male and female individuals who were previously well. This is an autoimmune condition called \"acquired hemophilia.\"Most coagulation laboratories can measure the plasma concentration of VWF protein (VWF antigen) by an immunoturbidimetric technique. Testing the functional activity of VWF, utilizes the drug ristocetin.The state of multimerization of VWF is important and is assessed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. Type 2a and 2b VWD are associated with the lack of intermediate- and high molecular weight multimers.The antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is an acquired autoimmune phenomenon associated with an increased incidence of both venous and arterial thromboses, as well as fetal loss. Typically, there is a paradoxical prolongation of the aPTT in the absence of any clinical features of bleeding. This is the so-called \"lupus anticoagulant (LA) effect.\" The laboratory definition of the APLS requires the presence of either a \"lupus anticoagulant\" or a persistent titer of antiphospholipid antibodies.There are now 2 broad classes of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs): [1] The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) such as dabigatran; and [2] The oral direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. The PT and aPTT are variably affected by the DOACs and are generally unhelpful in monitoring their concentrations. Most importantly, a normal PT or aPTT does NOT exclude the presence of any of the DOACs.Acquired hemophilia A is a rare but potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder. It is caused by the development of autoantibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII in adults or elderly patients, who do not have a personal or family history of bleeding.A man (age: 76 years) on prednisone and leflunomide for polymyalgia rheumatica developed spontaneous severe haematomas. The patient was diagnosed with acquired factor VIII deficiency (FVIII activity 1.2%, FVIII inhibitor 31.7 BU). Due to the active bleeding diathesis, treatment was administered with activated prothrombin complex concentrates (FEIBA&reg;, Baxter). Immunosuppressive treatment with a combination of oral prednisone (1 mg/kg daily) and cyclophosphamide (1,5 mg/kg daily) was administered to reduce the FVIII inhibitor. However, after two weeks of treatment, FVIII was only 3% and no clinical improvement was observed. Treatment with the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab intravenously at 375 mg/m2 once weekly for four consecutive weeks was started. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement following rituximab treatment. He achieved a complete remission defined as return to normal FVIII activity and undetectable FVIII inhibitor titer. After a follow-up of six months no relapse occurred.Rituximab appears an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with acquired haemophilia.The ultimate goal of hemophilia research is to cure the disease by permanently replacing the abnormal or deficient clotting factor. The most promising current approach is to insert a functional gene into the patient that will lead to the production of either the native protein or a compatible non-immunogenic equivalent version. This protein will circulate at adequate levels to prevent spontaneous bleeds and to treat traumatic hemorrhage. While there continues to be progress in this area, there remain significant hurdles to allow the process to be done at minimal risk to the patient. In the short term the goals are: 1) to prevent spontaneous bleeding whenever possible through the provision of effective prophylactic therapy, and 2) to rapidly establish hemostasis when bleeding occurs via effective, safe and widely available treatment modalities. In addition, all therapy should be convenient and simple to use so as to allow the vast majority of hemophilia patients to routinely treat themselves. Optimally, such treatment should not require highly trained medical personnel or vascular access. Prophylactic therapy will be facilitated via the development and introduction of clotting factors with prolonged circulating times. Long acting versions of rFVIIa, rFVIII and rFIX are either already in or are about to enter clinical trials. Rapid treatment of bleeding could be facilitated by bio-engineered molecules with increased activity and/or altered binding characteristics. At least one such agent is in phase II clinical trials. Ease of administration may be accomplished by the introduction of room temperature stable products and the development of subcutaneous and even orally administered therapeutics. It is conceivable that a broad spectrum hemostatic agent capable of normalizing thrombin generation in a variety of deficiencies could be developed. If this is accomplished, the steps to a room temperature stable agent, contained within a pre-filled pen, capable of self-delivery by subcutaneous injection are already within the realm of current developmental capabilities.Haemoperitoneum secondary to ruptured corpus luteum is a rare complication for women on anticoagulants and with certain congenital bleeding disorders. A surgical approach is often taken, leading to oophorectomy in many cases. We describe three patients presenting with haemoperitoneum in association with factor VII deficiency, factor X deficiency and sitosterolaemia. In two of the patients, recurrent episodes occurred prior to introduction of the oral contraceptive pill. Conservative management with blood product and factor concentrate support was successful in avoiding surgery in three of the five episodes of bleeding. These cases demonstrate that preservation of ovarian function is possible with a conservative approach and recurrent episodes may be prevented by suppression of ovulation.Fifty-two young individuals suffering from severe haemophilia A and B volunteered to be compared with school- and college-going students for oral health status description and subsequent management. A total of 244 students (84.42% boys and 15.58% girls) with the age group of 13-23 years were divided into two groups, A and B (controls). The purpose of this study was to increase awareness about evidence-based dental practices by oral examinations followed by comparisons of periodontal health and prevalence of malocclusions among medically compromised students and healthy controls. Results described the oral health in severe haemophilic population to be compromised with combined simplified health index score of 0.50 and Decayed/Modified/Filled Teeth (DMFT) index score of 2.07 when compared with 0.42 and 0.95, respectively, among group B. Although prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among group A were higher, yet it was not confirmed as a reason for degraded dental and periodontal status. However, spontaneous and/or toothbrush (trauma)-induced gingival bleeding episodes among group A could be explained as factors discouraging oral hygiene maintenance, particularly self-administered measures. Four haemophiliacs presented with symptoms of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome (TMPDS). Evidence-based oral medicine and clinical practices need to be encouraged and applied to enhance the quality of life among haemophiliacs, particularly in developing world. Dental treatment needs of haemophilic population appear to be greater and maybe incorporated in routine dental practices, at institutional and individual levels.An 88 year-old man was hospitalized because of bullous pemphigoid of the skin with detectable autoantibodies against type XVII collagen. During his stay in the hospital, he developed easily bleeding hemorrhagic bullous lesions of the oral mucosa, which were thought to be an oral manifestation of bullous pemphigoid. A thorough blood examination showed acquired haemophilia A, related to the development of autoantibodies against factor VIII.Haemophilia A, the most common of bleeding disorders is characterized by bruising and spontaneous bleeding into the joints but may remain undiagnosed if present in the mild form. A case is discussed where episodes of bruising and joint swelling as a child were misdiagnosed as rheumatic fever and the bleeding disorder was diagnosed following recurrent episodes of bleeding after extraction of an upper molar tooth.The use of ibuprofen (IBP) in hemophilic men for chronic hemophilic arthropathy is associated with transient coagulation abnormalities, but usually does not cause bleeding symptoms. However, when hemophilic men are treated with ibuprofen while also receiving zidovudine (ZDV), excess bleeding has occurred in some. In order to evaluate platelet function and pharmacokinetics of combination IBP and ZDV, we measured platelet aggregation, platelet adhesive index, bleeding time, and IBP and ZDV drug levels by high performance liquid chromatography on five patients receiving chronic oral IBP, 400 mg every 6 hr, and on ten patients receiving both IBP and ZDV, 100 or 200 mg every 4 hr five times daily. Samples were obtained at baseline (ZDV alone), acutely (IBP+ZDV acutely), and chronically (2 weeks on IBP and ZDV). Abnormal platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid occurred in four of five (80%) of those receiving IBP alone and in 7 of 10 (70%) at baseline, 9 of 10 (90%) at acute, and 8 of 10 (80%) at chronic IBP and ZDV treatment, most commonly at 2 hr following dosing, when peak IBP levels occurred, and persisting 4 hr in those on chronic dosing. Half or more of those on combination IBP+ZDV showed a lowered platelet adhesive index and/or prolonged bleeding time. Excess bleeding symptoms occurred in three on chronic combination IBP+ZDV, two with increased frequency of spontaneous hemorrhages, and one with prolonged traumatic bleeding. Bleeding tendency was unrelated to the degree of platelet function abnormality, to peak drug levels of IBP or ZDV, or degree of liver function abnormality (SGPT). The clearance of IBP alone and ZDV alone were not different from the clearance of combination IBP and ZDV. Caution is urged regarding potential enhanced bleeding tendency in hemophiliacs receiving both IBP and ZDV in combination.Hemophilia A is characterized by deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing. The age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to the level of factor VIII clotting activity. Individuals with The diagnosis of hemophilia A is established in an individual with low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal, functional von Willebrand factor level. Identification of a hemizygous Hemophilia A is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of a male proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. The risk to sibs of a female proband depends on the genetic status of the mother and father. If the mother of the proband has an Spontaneous hyphema is the rare occurrence of hemorrhage within the anterior chamber of the eye without a predisposing traumatic event. Hyphema can be associated with acute elevations in intraocular pressure in up to 30% of cases, which poses a significant risk for permanent vision loss if not quickly recognized and treated in the emergency department (ED). Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications have been previously associated with cases of spontaneous hyphema; however, there are limited reports of hyphema with associated acute glaucoma in a patient taking a direct oral anticoagulant. Due to the limited data of reversal therapies for direct oral anticoagulants in intraocular hemorrhage, these patients pose a challenge in deciding whether to reverse anticoagulation in the ED.We present a case of a 79-year-old man on apixaban anticoagulation therapy who presented to the ED with spontaneous painful vision loss in the right eye with associated hyphema. Point-of-care ultrasound revealed an associated vitreous hemorrhage, and tonometry was significant for acute glaucoma. As a result, the decision was made to reverse the patient's anticoagulation with four-factor activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? This case is an example of acute secondary glaucoma due to a hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage. There is limited evidence regarding anticoagulation reversal in this setting. A second site of bleeding was identified by utilization of point-of-care ultrasound, which led to the diagnosis of a vitreous hemorrhage. This allowed for shared decision-making between the emergency physician, ophthalmologist, and patient regarding the risks and potential benefits of the reversal of anticoagulation. Ultimately, the patient decided to have his anticoagulation reversed to try and preserve vision.Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant in Nepal. It is commonly used for chronic anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and artificial heart valves. The major side effect of warfarin is bleeding. Though extremely rare, a sublingual hematoma can lead to life-threatening complications as it can cause severe airway obstruction. We present a case of a 55-year-old female patient who had sublingual hematoma secondary to the use of Warfarin therapy. In addition to the discontinuation of warfarin, she was managed conservatively without any surgical intervention. Early diagnosis, timely discontinuation of the drug, and application of appropriate medical treatment are of utmost importance for reducing morbidity and mortality due to bleeding and airway compromise.The aim of this article was to present the medical management and follow-up of a recurrent oral granuloma gravidarum (OGG). OGG is a common benign tumour that can occur during pregnancy in response to poor oral hygiene and hormonal factors. Its identification and management by primary health care professionals is necessary, including an orientation to a dentist, if needed. Indeed, this lesion may induce troubles such as gingival bleeding, oral hygiene difficulties, and sometimes pain or eating difficulties, but also presents a high risk of relapse. An early twenties woman consulted several times during two pregnancies for an OGG presented in the same proximal maxillary gingival area. The patient reported dental hygiene difficulties because of orthodontic treatment and developed this recurrent tumour four times in two years, despite surgical excisions. Oral hygiene, and information continuously provided by healthcare professionals are required to prevent gingival inflammation and recurrence of OGG. This tumour usually regresses spontaneously post-partum, except in the presence of aggravating factors such as orthodontics treatment and mouth breathing. Surgery of OGG is required when it interferes with normal oral functions.Warfarin induces coagulopathy. Guidelines protocolize reversal of supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) in patients dependent on anticoagulation, but practices vary for reversing warfarin-induced coagulopathy after overdose in non-warfarin-dependent patients. This is the report of a 15-year-old female who ingested her father's warfarin (100-200 mg) in a self-harm attempt. At hour 24 post-ingestion, her INR was 2.00 and she was admitted for monitoring. Reversal of coagulopathy was initially deferred pending the INR trend. The INR was 5.10 at hour 60 and 2.5 mg oral vitamin K. A restrictive approach to coagulopathy reversal in non-warfarin-dependent patients with intentional warfarin overdose may result in worsening coagulopathy, bleeding, and lengthy hospital stay. Given the risk for significant, prolonged coagulopathy, these patients should be treated early with VK1, with subsequent serial INR monitoring and probable additional VK1 dosing. Delayed peak warfarin concentrations support consideration of gastrointestinal decontamination in late presenters.Spontaneous hemorrhage is a known risk for patients on anticoagulation therapy. Most previous spontaneous airway hemorrhage cases reported involve warfarin, and of the few that involved a direct oral anticoagulant, none involved the epiglottis. The following case describes a spontaneous epiglottic hematoma in a patient one week after starting a direct oral anticoagulant. An 85-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute onset of neck swelling, odynophagia and sublingual ecchymosis. Evaluation in the emergency department included advanced imaging of the neck and consultation with otolaryngology. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed a markedly enlarged and ecchymotic epiglottis. The patient received medical management including rivaroxaban reversal, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no airway management was deemed necessary. After close monitoring, the patient was discharged on hospital day two. Further research and risk profiling could benefit patients and emergency clinicians when considering spontaneous hemorrhage in the airway in patients taking a direct oral anticoagulant.Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may simplify management of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Here, we report our experience with off-label use of DOACs for anticoagulation in BCS.The safety of DOAC vs vitamin K antagonist treatment as well as associated clinical outcomes were retrospectively assessed in 47 BCS patients treated at 6 Austrian centers.Mean age at study inclusion was 37.9 ± 14.0 years and mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease was 13.1 ± 5.1. Overall, 63.8% (n = 30) of patients had decompensated liver disease, and 87.2% (n = 41) showed clinical signs of portal hypertension. During a median follow-up of 82.5 (interquartile range, 43.1-121.8) months, 43 (91.5%) patients received anticoagulation alone or following interventional treatment, including 22 (46.8%) patients treated with DOACs (edoxaban: 10, apixaban: 4, rivaroxaban: 3, dabigatran: 3, more than one DOAC sequentially: 2) for a median of 24.4 (interquartile range, 5.7-35.1) months. While 72.7% (n = 16 of 22) of patients were switched from low-molecular-weight heparin (n = 12) or vitamin K antagonist (n = 4) to DOAC after disease stabilization or improvement, 27.3% (n = 6 of 22) of BCS patients were initially treated with DOAC. Complete response (European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria) was achieved or maintained in 14 (63.6%) of 22 patients, with ongoing response in 2 patients, while disease progressed in 6 patients (including 2 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma). Four major spontaneous bleedings (18.2%; incidence rate 8.8 per 100 patient-years; n = 2 upper gastrointestinal bleeding, n = 1 lower gastrointestinal bleeding, n = 1 hepatocellular carcinoma rupture), 7 minor bleedings, and 1 major procedure-related bleeding (4.5%; 2.2 per 100 patient-years) occurred during DOAC therapy. Overall transplant-free survival was 91.6% at 5 years.DOACs seem to be effective and safe for long-term anticoagulation in patients with BCS, but confirmation by larger prospective studies is needed.Hypertension is the most prevalent determinant condition embarking on the development of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Usually, the presentation is a unilateral hematoma. Spontaneous bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage is an outstandingly infrequent context, and not a lot of cases have been reported till date. Ensuing hypertension, trauma inflicted on the brain case is another common cause that out turn into the sequelae of bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage. Lately, a few cases of bilateral basal ganglia bleed have been revealed, as a repercussion of COVID-19 infection. Globally, <40 such cases have been reported. A 39-year-old man presented with complaints of acute onset of weakness of right half of the body. Additionally, facial deviation was noticed by his family members. He then sought medical help from a local healthcare center where CT scan of head was advised. Unexpectedly, the scan demonstrated bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage. He was then managed conservatively with oral medications and rehabilitation. The course of his hospital stay was uneventful and was eventually discharged after 9 days. He then presented to our institution for further evaluation. Thereupon, he had slurring of speech but was able to walk with minimal support. Simultaneous Bilateral Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage (SBBGH) is an exceptionally rare ailment. This genre of cerebrovascular accident embraces a comprehensive span of morbidity and mortality. In an acute setting, CT scan of head is the most relevant imaging modality. Nonetheless, MRI is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and should be performed urgently to further typify and delineate the lesion.Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a congenital neurological disorder that is characterized by hamartomas involving the skin, brain, and eyes and marked by the presence of the facial port-wine stain, which consequently leads to various ocular complications. Among all ocular comorbidities, glaucoma is the most frequently witnessed in SWS patients with a prevalence of 30%-70%. If glaucoma is refractory to conventional medical management, surgical intervention can be considered. Common complications of glaucoma procedures in SWS are choroidal detachment and suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Moreover, we report a 6-year-old girl, known case of unilateral congenital glaucoma secondary to SWS. Despite being on maximal antiglaucoma drops and undergoing multiple surgical interventions, the patient had uncontrolled intraocular pressure of her right eye. A decision to proceed with Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation (AGVI) to the right eye was made. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed hemorrhagic choroidal detachment and exudative retinal detachment. A trial of oral propranolol (1.5-2 mg/kg/day) was then initiated for 4 months. After 30 days from oral propranolol course initiation, we started noticing a significant improvement of the hemorrhagic choroidal and exudative retinal detachment. Spontaneously, a marked reduction in subretinal fluid and suprachoroidal hemorrhage was also seen. Thus, the improvement was correlated with the propranolol therapy. Here, we report a significant improvement of the postoperative complications of AGVI in a patient with SWS, following 4 months of oral propranolol course (1.5-2 mg/kg/day). Further studies are needed to determine the dosage, duration, and optimal mechanism by which propranolol works in this situation.Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare bleeding disorder due to defects in the glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa complex present on the platelet membrane. The most common mode of treatment for this disorder is platelet transfusion. However, scientific evidence does state that repeated transfusions could lead to auto immunization making transfusions ineffective.To describe the use of a novel technique of soft splint with tranexamic acid paste to stop oral bleeding in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT).A 7-year-old female patient with a known history of GT was referred to the pediatric department. The chief complaint of the patient revealed a history of spontaneous bleeding from the oral cavity. The patient required multiple teeth extractions due to severely carious teeth. History revealed that the patient was admitted to the hospital (casualty) three times within 1 month due to a similar complaint leading to hypovolemic shock. Several transfusion procedures were done to stop the spontaneous bleeding. To stop the intraoral bleeding without transfusions, a novel method of using a soft splint with tranexamic acid paste (500 mg tablet crushed and mixed with saline) in the area of spontaneous bleeding was employed with a successful follow-up of 7 months. Soft splint with the tranexamic acid paste can serve as an effective method of treatment for patients with spontaneous oral bleeding due to medical conditions like GT.This case report highlights the need for awareness among all the healthcare providers about the importance of regular dental visits. The healthcare providers also need to emphasize the same to all patients with medical conditions to avoid such life-threatening situations. Bhavyaa R, Vignesh KC, Muthu MS, The incidence of accidental ingestion and aspiration of foreign body (FB) is likely to occur. Many FBs are discharged spontaneously, but many dental FBs are often sharp and may remain in the pharynx, esophagus, and stomach, causing serious complications such as hemorrhage, asphyxia, perforation of the digestive tract, mediastinal emphysema, peritonitis, and ileus. We aimed to examine which type of dental foreign bodies can be removed by endoscope.In this study, we enrolled 32 patients who were evaluated at the Emergency and Critical Center between January 2014 and December 2019 and who accidentally ingested or aspirated dental FBs. Medical records were reviewed to determine the patients' sex, age, medical history, time from accidental ingestion of a FB to consultation, cause, location, occurrence status, nature of the FB, location of retained FB, treatment, complications, and outcome.We enrolled 32 patients (14 men, 18 women), with a mean age of 74.5 ± 12.8 years. Accidental ingestion at treatment was common. The most frequent site where the FB was retained was upper gastrointestinal tract (26 cases, 81.3%). In this study, endoscopic removal was indicated for dentures under the size of 43.3 mm, for dental FB (except dentures) more than 13.6 mm. In dentures, between the number of missing teeth, clasp, type, and endoscopic removal was not statistically significant.Dentures under the size of 43.3 mm was likely to be removed by endoscope. Dental FB (except dentures) more than the size of 13.6 mm was likely to be removed by endoscope. There were no indications for endoscopic removal except for size.BACKGROUND COVID-19 is associated with many hematological manifestations, including lymphopenia and thrombosis. There have been rare occasions in which thrombocytopenia has been reported as the sole clinical presentation of COVID-19. CASE REPORT This is the case report of a 48-year-old Hispanic female patient with COVID-19 presenting as severe isolated thrombocytopenia. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with hemoptysis, spontaneous bruising, and excessive vaginal bleeding and also reported a recent flu-like illness. On examination, she was found to have bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, diffuse oral ulcers, epigastric abdominal tenderness, and ecchymosis on her chest, with scattered petechiae and palpable purpura on her lower limbs. Laboratory results were significant for a platelet count of 0x10⁹ and an immature platelet fraction of 34.1%. Owing to clinical suspicion, the patient was tested for COVID-19, and her test result was positive. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisone, rituximab, vitamin C, and zinc. Upon achieving hemodynamic stability, she was discharged to follow up with a hematologist in the outpatient setting. CONCLUSIONS Hematological consequences of COVID-19 are becoming more prevalent. The mechanism behind this manifestation could be bone marrow failure, formation of platelet autoantibodies, or consumptive coagulopathy. These critical manifestations are necessary to manage, especially in severe forms like in our patient. Steroids and rituximab combination therapy have proven to be the most effective regimen.The goal was to determine whether changes in the inclination of lower incisors and canines upon orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances poses a threat for labial gingival recession in adult patients.The sample of this prospective clinical trial consisted of 32 adult patients (mean age 25.08 ±6.50 years) treated with fixed appliances. Plaque and bleeding indices, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, gingival recession height (GR) and width (GRW), gingival thickness (GT), and keratinized tissue width were clinically recorded, while cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to evaluate teeth inclination before (T1) and after treatment (T2). Oral hygiene, brushing habits, and smoking were controlled.During orthodontic treatment on 15 (8.33%) teeth (10 incisors and 5 canines), spontaneous complete improvement of pre-existing GR was observed. On 2 incisors, GR decreased and on 3 teeth GR did not change. Moreover, 1 incisor presented an increased GR, while 2 teeth developed new defects. Mean GR, GRW, and GT decreased significantly only on the incisors. Proclination of incisors and canines during treatment (compared with retroclination of the teeth) implicated a lower reduction in GR at T2: 0.19 mm (p = 0.034) and 0.18 mm (p = 0.037), respectively. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that more tooth proclination was associated with a higher risk for an increase in GR (p < 0.00).",

        "annotations":"Properly planned changes in lower incisor and canine inclination can be carried out in adult patients without posing a high risk to labial gingival recessions if the individual periodontal biotype is respected. The reported outcomes underscore the orthodontic principle to keep tooth roots inside the alveolar bone.Occurrences of rare oral complications following herpes zoster (HZ) infection have been reported. In the present case, a 57-year-old man was referred for periodontal evaluation due to gingival bleeding. His medical history included diagnoses of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and HZ infection. Intraoral examination revealed necrosis and alveolar bone exposure around the mandibular left lateral incisor, and the patient reported spontaneous exfoliation of the maxillary and mandibular left central incisors. Conservative surgical and antibiotic therapies were provided to the patient, and a diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw following HZ infection was established. There were no signs of recurrence in 17 months of follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of unusual complications related to a previous HZ infection.Anticoagulation carries a tremendous therapeutic advantage in reducing morbidity and mortality with venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation. For over six decades, traditional anticoagulants like low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists like warfarin have been used to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. In the past decade, multiple new direct oral anticoagulants have emerged and been approved for clinical use. Since their introduction, direct oral anticoagulants have changed the landscape of anticoagulants. With increasing indications and use in various patients, they have become the mainstay of treatment in venous thromboembolic diseases. The safety profile of direct oral anticoagulants is better or at least similar to warfarin, but several recent reports are focusing on spontaneous hemorrhages with direct oral anticoagulants. This narrative review aims to summarize the incidence of spontaneous hemorrhage in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants and also offers practical management strategies for clinicians when patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants present with bleeding complications.The anti-progesterone drug mifepristone and the prostaglandin misoprostol can be used to treat missed miscarriage. However, it is unclear whether a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective than administering misoprostol alone. We investigated whether treatment with mifepristone plus misoprostol would result in a higher rate of completion of missed miscarriage compared with misoprostol alone.MifeMiso was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in 28 UK hospitals. Women were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 16 years and older, diagnosed with a missed miscarriage by pelvic ultrasound scan in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, chose to have medical management of miscarriage, and were willing and able to give informed consent. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a single dose of oral mifepristone 200 mg or an oral placebo tablet, both followed by a single dose of vaginal, oral, or sublingual misoprostol 800 μg 2 days later. Randomisation was managed via a secure web-based randomisation program, with minimisation to balance study group assignments according to maternal age (<30 years vs ≥30 years), body-mass index (<35 kg/m) Between Oct 3, 2017, and July 22, 2019, 2595 women were identified as being eligible for the MifeMiso trial. 711 women were randomly assigned to receive either mifepristone and misoprostol (357 women) or placebo and misoprostol (354 women). 696 (98%) of 711 women had available data for the primary outcome. 59 (17%) of 348 women in the mifepristone plus misoprostol group did not pass the gestational sac spontaneously within 7 days versus 82 (24%) of 348 women in the placebo plus misoprostol group (risk ratio [RR] 0·73, 95% CI 0·54-0·99; p=0·043). 62 (17%) of 355 women in the mifepristone plus misoprostol group required surgical intervention to complete the miscarriage versus 87 (25%) of 353 women in the placebo plus misoprostol group (0·71, 0·53-0·95; p=0·021). We found no difference in incidence of adverse events between the study groups.Treatment with mifepristone plus misoprostol was more effective than misoprostol alone in the management of missed miscarriage. Women with missed miscarriage should be offered mifepristone pretreatment before misoprostol to increase the chance of successful miscarriage management, while reducing the need for miscarriage surgery.",

The study was approved by the ethics Committee of Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University. According to the random use of GPIs drugs, they were assigned to the eptifibatide group and tirofiban group. Basic data, platelet inhibition rates at baseline, 24h and 72h after administration, short-term major adverse cerebrovascular events, and bleeding complications were compared between the two groups.A total of 47 patients were included in this study, including 24 patients in eptifibatide group and 23 patients in tirofiban group. There was no significant difference in average age (53.75) Both eptifibatide and tirofiban can effectively inhibit platelets, but the effect of etifeptide is better than that of tirofiban in preventing intracranial microhemorrhage and asymptomatic cerebral infarction.Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a neglected disease affecting 33 million people, mainly in low and middle income countries. Yet very few large trials or registries have been conducted in this population. The INVICTUS program of research in RHD consists of a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of 4500 patients comparing rivaroxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with RHD and atrial fibrillation (AF), a registry of 17,000 patients to document the contemporary clinical course of patients with RHD, including a focused sub-study on pregnant women with RHD within the registry. This paper describes the rationale, design, organization and baseline characteristics of the RCT and a summary of the design of the registry and its sub-study. Patients with RHD and AF are considered to be at high risk of embolic strokes, and oral anticoagulation with VKAs is recommended for stroke prevention. But the quality of anticoagulation with VKA is poor in developing countries. A drug which does not require monitoring, and which is safe and effective for preventing stroke in patients with valvular AF, would fulfill a major unmet need.",

        "annotations":"INVICTUS is the largest program of clinical research focused on a neglected cardiovascular disease and will provide new information on the clinical course of patients with RHD, and approaches to anticoagulation in those with concomitant AF.Spontaneous intramural hematoma of the alimentary canal has rarely been reported. We present two cases in which anticoagulation therapy brings spontaneous intramural hematoma of the alimentary canal. In one case, the lesion was located in the ileum, and the other was located in the ascending colon and distal ileum. Both patients were cured through conservative treatment. We suggest that increased attention should be paid if a patient has acute abdominal pain with a history of oral anticoagulant therapy, and the diagnosis of spontaneous intermural hematoma should be considered.In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), several non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers and the spot sign (SS) in computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) have been established for the prediction of hematoma growth and neurological outcome. However, the prognostic value of these markers in patients under oral anticoagulation (ORAC) is unclear. We hypothesized that outcome prediction by these imaging markers may be significantly different between patients with and without ORAC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of NCCT markers and SS in patients with ICH under ORAC.This is a retrospective study of the database for patients with ICH at a German tertiary stroke center. Inclusion criteria were (1) patients with ICH, (2) oral anticoagulation within the therapeutic range, and (3) NCCT and CTA performed on admission within 6 h after onset of symptoms. We defined a binary outcome: modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3 = good outcome versus mRS > 3 = poor outcome at discharge. The predictive value of each sign was assessed in uni- and multivariable logistic regression models. Of 129 patients with ICH under ORAC, 76 (58.9%) presented with hypodensities within the hematoma in admission NCCT, 64 (52.7%) presented with an irregular shape of the hematoma, 60 (46.5%) presented with a swirl sign, 49 (38.0%) presented with a black hole sign, and 46 (35.7%) presented with a heterogeneous density of the hematoma. Moreover, 44 (34.1%) patients had a satellite sign, in 20 (15.5%) patients, an island sign was detected, 18 (14.0%) patients were blend-sign positive, and 14 (10.9%) patients presented with a CTA spot sign. Inter-rater agreement was very high for all included characteristics between the two readers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the presence of black hole sign (odds ratio 10.59; The distribution and prognostic value of several NCCT markers and CTA spot sign in ICH patients under ORAC is comparable to those with spontaneous ICH, even though these parameters are partly based on coagulant status. These findings suggest that a similar approach can be used for further research regarding outcome prediction in ICH patients under ORAC and those with spontaneous ICH.Although the risk of major bleeding with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is low, life-threatening bleeding can occur.We report a case of an 81-year-old female with deep vein thrombosis who developed bilateral spontaneous haemothorax and haemopericardium after rivaroxaban therapy. Diagnostic thoracentesis revealed a grossly bloody pleural effusion. She was treated with factor eight inhibitor bypassing agent, but the result was not satisfactory. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a concomitant presentation of spontaneous bilateral haemothorax and haemopericardium due to rivaroxaban use. This case highlights the potential risk of major haemorrhagic complication of NOAC, which could be life-threatening and require emergent reversal.Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now the first choice thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients who do not have a high risk of bleeding. In addition to the anticoagulant effects, potential anti-tumor effects of DOACs have also been studied in animal cancer models. In this study, we summarize the effects of DOACs on cancer growth and metastasis in animal models through a systematic review with a qualitative analysis.",

        "annotations":"PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were systematically searched for original studies that describe animal models of cancer in which one of the experimental groups received DOAC monotherapy, and which reported quantitatively on primary tumor or metastases.Nine studies - reporting a total of 19 animal experiments - met the inclusion criteria. These 19 experiments included spontaneous cancer (n = 2), carcinogenicity (n = 2), xenograft (n = 7) and syngeneic (n = 8) models, encompassing orthotopic (n = 7), subcutaneous (n = 5), intraperitoneal (n = 1) and intravenous (n = 2) injection of cancer cells and included treatments with the DOACs ximelagatran (n = 4), dabigatran etexilate (n = 6) and/or rivaroxaban (n = 11). DOAC treatment decreased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 18.8% (3/16) and 20.0% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively. Conversely, DOACs increased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 6.3% (1/16) and 20.0% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively.DOAC monotherapy resulted in neoplastic changes in a rat carcinogenicity study, showed a lack of effect in mouse xenograft models, while the effect on cancer growth and metastasis in mouse syngeneic models depended on the timing of DOAC treatment and type of cancer model used.Etrasimod (APD334) is an oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator in development for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. We assessed the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).In a phase 2, proof-of-concept, double-blind, parallel-group study, adult outpatients with modified Mayo Clinic scores (MCSs) (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopy findings) of 4-9, endoscopic subscores of 2 or more, and rectal bleeding subscores of 1 or more were randomly assigned to groups given once-daily etrasimod 1 mg (n = 52), etrasimod 2 mg (n = 50), or placebo (n = 54) for 12 weeks. The study was performed from October 15, 2015, through February 14, 2018, at 87 centers in 17 countries. The primary endpoint was an increase in the mean improvement in modified MCS from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with endoscopic improvement (subscores of 1 or less) from baseline to week 12. Exploratory endpoints, including clinical remission, are reported in the article, although the study was statistically powered to draw conclusions only on the primary endpoint.At week 12, the etrasimod 2 mg group met the primary and all secondary endpoints. Etrasimod 2 mg led to a significantly greater increase in mean improvement in modified MCS from baseline than placebo (difference from placebo, 0.99 points; 90% confidence interval, 0.30-1.68; P = .009), and etrasimod 1 mg led to an increase in mean improvement from baseline in modified MCS of 0.43 points more than placebo (90% confidence interval, reduction of 0.24 to increase of 1.11; nominal P = .15). Endoscopic improvement occurred in 41.8% of patients receiving etrasimod 2 mg vs 17.8% receiving placebo (P = .003). Most adverse events were mild to moderate. Three patients had a transient, asymptomatic, low-grade atrioventricular block that resolved spontaneously all patients had evidence of atrioventricular block before etrasimod exposure.In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, etrasimod 2 mg was more effective than placebo in producing clinical and endoscopic improvements. Further clinical development is warranted. Clinicaltrials.gov, Number: NCT02447302.There is limited research on intracerebral hemorrhage in young urban populations. There is reduced access to healthcare and a high prevalence of multiple comorbidities in this vulnerable population. We studied the etiologies and outcomes of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in an urban North Philadelphia cohort aged 50 years old and younger.A retrospective chart review of subjects 50 years old and younger who presented with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage at Temple University Hospital was conducted. A novel scoring system was used to classify the cause of each intracerebral hemorrhage. This system was used to assign a degree of likelihood that hypertension, amyloid angiopathy, tumor, oral anticoagulants, vascular malformations, infrequent causes, or cryptogenic etiologies were present. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage was excluded. The prevalence of each risk factor and outcomes were analyzed.Of the 110 patients in the study, the most common etiology was hypertension (82.7%). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between patients with multiple possible etiologies for their hemorrhage. Vascular malformations and cavernomas were rare (5.5%).Hypertension was the most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in a young urban population. The presence of multiple possible etiologies does not correlate with a worse prognosis of mortality. There is a need for further research into hemorrhagic stroke in young populations.A retrobulbar hemorrhage is a rapidly worsening emergent condition characteristically associated with significant orbital or facial trauma. Spontaneous hemorrhage into the retrobulbar compartment is rare. If not managed in a timely manner, it can lead to permanent vision loss. Rivaroxaban is a directly acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits factor Xa and is widely used for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib).Despite the risk of bleeding is a well-known adverse effect of oral anticoagulants, there is scarce evidence on the preventability of oral anticoagulant-induced bleedings. Therefore, we investigated the potential risk factors related to preventable cases of oral anticoagulant-induced bleedings.We performed a study using Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) with an oral anticoagulant as suspected drug among those reported through the spontaneous reporting system of Campania Region from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2017. The P-method was used for the preventability assessment of all cases of bleeding.In total, 58 cases out of 253 (22.9%) were preventable, and the most reported suspected drug was an indirect oral anticoagulant (warfarin). Sixty-eight critical criteria for preventability were identified, all related to healthcare professionals' practices. The most detected risk factor related to healthcare professionals' practices was the labeled drug-drug interaction for both direct and indirect oral anticoagulants.Our findings describe the most reported risk factors for preventability of oral anticoagulant-induced bleedings. These factors may be useful for targeting interventions to improve pharmacovigilance activities in our regional territory and to reduce the burden of medication errors and inappropriate prescription.The development of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has led to an alternative to treatment with warfarin. However, real-world data on comparing safety profiles of NOACs and warfarin are insufficient.The purpose of this study was to compare safety profiles of warfarin and NOACs using a spontaneous reporting system database.Adverse event reports spontaneously submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (Japan) between April 2011 and January 2017 were analysed. We performed disproportionality analyses, calculating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).The database comprised 3445 reports associated with warfarin, and 14,269 reports with NOACs. A large number of bleeding complications were detected with the use of both warfarin and NOACs. As for cerebral haemorrhage, the signal scores were greater for NOACs as a class (ROR 25.1, 95% CI 23.3-27) and individual agents (edoxaban: ROR 23.6, 95% CI 18.6-29.9; rivaroxaban ROR 23.9, 95% CI 21.4-26.8; apixaban ROR 28.1, 95% CI 25.4-31.1) than for warfarin (ROR 18.9, 95% CI 16.4-21.7), but showed the lowest value for dabigatran (ROR 9.26, 95% CI 7.76-11). Gastrointestinal haemorrhage had stronger signals for NOACs (ROR 19.4, 95% CI 17.8-21.1) than warfarin (ROR 12.2, 95% CI 10.2-14.6). With respect to calciphylaxis, the association with warfarin was noteworthy (ROR 190; 95% CI, 126-287), but no reports were detected involving NOACs.Our results may provide useful information for treatment with oral anticoagulants, although further studies with more data are needed.For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations, current consensus recommends uninterrupted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) considering low incidence of bleeding or thrombo-embolic events. It remains unknown whether uninterrupted strategy outweighs discontinuation method for patients receiving NOAC.From January 1, 2013 to June 1, 2017, we enrolled 100 patients (mean age 78.3 ± 10.2 years, 58% male) with AF taking NOAC for stroke prevention eligible for CIED implantation in a tertiary medical center, Taipei, Taiwan. NOAC was continued without skipping any doses during the surgery. The baseline characteristics, underlying diseases, CHA2DS2-VASc score, and clinical course of every patient were reviewed and analyzed.Among these patients, 28 were on dabigatran, 61 on rivaroxaban, 10 on apixaban, and one on edoxaban, respectively. There were no adverse events except one case of pericardial effusion and another one with large pocket hematoma. One patient receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation had late onset of pericardial effusion with impending tamponade necessitating pericardiocentesis. Another patient had large pocket hematoma, which spontaneously resolved within 1 month without further intervention. No periprocedural mortality and stroke occurred. Uninterrupted NOAC during CIED implantations may be an acceptable option especially in patients with high risk for thromboembolism. However, special caution should be paid during defibrillator implantation considering relatively higher risk of bleeding, perhaps due to the larger size of the defibrillator lead.We report the case of a 36-year old male, under stable rivaroxaban therapy for 18 months, who was admitted to our emergency room with sudden onset of hemoptysis. Anticoagulant therapy was given after recurrent spontaneous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a heterozygous Factor-V-Leiden mutation was present. There was no co-medication reported, however, the patient reported a constant intake of three liters of home-brewn ginger tea per day in the last month. The patient was hospitalized to further investigate the reason of hemoptysis.Gingival bleeding is a common intraoral finding, typically associated with inflamed tissues and periodontal disease. It is easily provoked by periodontal probing or toothbrushing. Spontaneous gingival bleeding rarely occurs and may be the only sign of systemic bleeding problems such as thrombocytopenia, leukaemia or coagulopathy. In pregnancy, acute onset of thrombocytopenia may occur in systemic disorders such as severe pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) or the acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The diagnosis and management of such conditions may challenge physicians. It requires a systematic approach with a comprehensive history to exclude causes of gingival haemorrhage such as periodontal disease, anticoagulant therapy, maxillofacial trauma, haematological disorders or a bacterial infection. The authors describe a case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura presenting with spontaneous gingival haemorrhage in pregnancy. This case highlights the fact that medical intervention to correct the underlying aberration of haemostasis is necessary for local measures to stop the gingival bleeding successfully.We investigated the precise clinical and radiologic characteristics of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with direct oral anticoagulant use.Patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage admitted to our department from September 2014 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and neuroradiological characteristics of patients with direct oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage, and effects of prior treatment on the severity at admission and on outcome at discharge were assessed.",

Median initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores differed significantly among the groups (P = .0283). Systolic blood pressure (P = .0031) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = .0019) were significantly lower in the oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage group than in other groups. Total small vessel disease scores were significantly higher in the oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage group than in the warfarin group (P = .0413). Multivariate analysis revealed that prior oral anticoagulant treatment (odds ratio: 0.21, 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.96, P = .0445) was independently negatively associated with moderate-to-severe neurological severity (stroke scale score ≥10) after adjusting for intracerebral hemorrhage location and various risk factors. There were significant differences in hematoma volume in the basal ganglia (P = .0366).DOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage may occur particularly in patients with a high risk of bleeding; however, they had a milder initial neurological severity than those with warfarin-related intracerebral hemorrhage, possibly due to relatively smaller hematoma volume, especially in the basal ganglia.Growing evidence indicates that the risk of obstetric and perinatal outcomes is higher in women with assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, there is little known about pregnancy related complications and co-morbidity in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) following singleton pregnancies achieved by ART in comparison with spontaneous conception (SC).Two hundred sixty singleton pregnant women conceived by ART and 314 pregnant women conceived by spontaneous conception (SC) were participated in this prospective cohort study. All participants were enrolled after GDM screening through one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and then grouped into GDM and non-GDM groups. Women were followed for pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preeclampsia, antepartum hemorrhage (APH), cesarean section (CS), preterm birth (PTB), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), being small or large for gestational age (SGA or LGA), macrosomia, low birth weight (LBW), respiratory distress, neonatal hypoglycemia, NICU admission and perinatal mortality from antenatal visits to delivery. Confounding factors were adjusted in logistic regression model in order to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs).Among 260 ART and 314 SC, 135 and 152 women were GDM women, respectively. Higher maternal age and pre-gravid BMI, shorter duration of gestation and lower gestational weight gain were observed in GDM groups (ART-GDM and SC-GDM) compared to those of the SC group. ART-GDM group had a higher risk (95% confidence interval) of obstetric complications including PIH [aOR:7.04 (2.24-22.15)], preeclampsia [aOR:7.78 (1.62-37.47)], APH [aOR:3.46 (1.28-9.33)], emergency CS [aOR:2.64 (1.43-4.88)], and perinatal outcomes such as PTB [aOR:3.89 (1.51-10.10)], LBW [aOR:3.11 (1.04-9.30)] and NICU admission [aOR:4.36 (1.82-10.45)], as well as neonatal hypoglycemia [aOR: 4.91 (1.50-16.07)], compared to SC group. SC-GDM group showed a higher risk of PIH [aOR: 4.12 (1.31-12.89)], emergency CS [aOR: 2.01 (1.09-3.73] and LGA [aOR: 5.20 (1.07-25.20)], compared to SC group. Additionally, ART group had a higher risk of PIH [aOR: 3.46(1.02-11.68), preeclampsia 5.29 (1.03-27.09), and NICU admission [aOR: 2.53 (1.05-6.09)] compared to SC. Insulin requirement (41.8% vs. 25.7%) was significantly higher in ART-GDM group compared to SC-GDM group.The findings of this study suggest that GDM occurring after ART conception increases the risk of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes.The appearance in the mouth of haemorrhagic petechiae, ecchymoses or blood blisters with spontaneous bleeding is suggestive of a haemorrhagic disorder that may be caused either by functional impairment of platelets or of blood vessel walls, by an abnormal decrease in the number of circulating platelets (thrombocytopaenia), or by defects in the blood clotting mechanism. Thrombocytopaenia from decreased production or increased destruction of platelets may be caused by multiple factors including immune mediated mechanisms, drugs or infections. A diagnosis of thrombocytopaenic purpura can be made when any other disease entity that might be causing the purpura is excluded on the basis of the medical history, the physical examination, a complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear. In this paper, we outline the clinical features of oral thrombocytopaenic purpura and briefly discuss some aspects of its aetiopathogenesis and treatment.Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous disorder, characterized by leptomeningeal angiomas involving the oral cavity, trachea, larynx, and face. Herein, we present a case of vitrectomy in a seven-year-old boy with SWS. The patient showed hemangioma on the left side of his face, as well as mental retardation and epilepsy. Preoperative examination revealed no apparent hemangioma in the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, or trachea. However, he was predicted to have difficult airway intubation, as the oral cavity was smaller than the normal size. The minimum Mallampati score was 3-4 due to macroglossia. First, we applied awake intubation, but he failed to follow the commands. We proceeded to general anesthesia with propofol and did not use any muscle relaxants to maintain spontaneous breathing. A laryngeal mask airway was inserted to minimize any harm to possible oral angiomas. The patient was hemodynamically stable and extubated without any complications, such as bleeding or respiratory problems.Medical management of early pregnancy loss is an alternative to uterine aspiration, but standard medical treatment with misoprostol commonly results in treatment failure. We compared the efficacy and safety of pretreatment with mifepristone followed by treatment with misoprostol with the efficacy and safety of misoprostol use alone for the management of early pregnancy loss.We randomly assigned 300 women who had an anembryonic gestation or in whom embryonic or fetal death was confirmed to receive pretreatment with 200 mg of mifepristone, administered orally, followed by 800 μg of misoprostol, administered vaginally (mifepristone-pretreatment group), or 800 μg of misoprostol alone, administered vaginally (misoprostol-alone group). Participants returned 1 to 4 days after misoprostol use for evaluation, including ultrasound examination, by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment-group assignments. Women in whom the gestational sac was not expelled were offered expectant management, a second dose of misoprostol, or uterine aspiration. We followed all participants for 30 days after randomization. Our primary outcome was gestational sac expulsion with one dose of misoprostol by the first follow-up visit and no additional intervention within 30 days after treatment.Complete expulsion after one dose of misoprostol occurred in 124 of 148 women (83.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 76.8 to 89.3) in the mifepristone-pretreatment group and in 100 of 149 women (67.1%; 95% CI, 59.0 to 74.6) in the misoprostol-alone group (relative risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.43). Uterine aspiration was performed less frequently in the mifepristone-pretreatment group than in the misoprostol-alone group (8.8% vs. 23.5%; relative risk, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.68). Bleeding that resulted in blood transfusion occurred in 2.0% of the women in the mifepristone-pretreatment group and in 0.7% of the women in the misoprostol-alone group (P=0.31); pelvic infection was diagnosed in 1.3% of the women in each group.Pretreatment with mifepristone followed by treatment with misoprostol resulted in a higher likelihood of successful management of first-trimester pregnancy loss than treatment with misoprostol alone.

It infrequently presents as spontaneous renal haemorrhage (SRH). Genital malformation and SRH secondary to choriocarcinoma has previously been only reported in females. We present what we believe to be the first case of a male patient with genital malformation (hypospadias and cryptorchidism) and SRH at presentation of choriocarcinoma.A 25-year-old man presented to the department with intense pain in the right flank region and lower back. Initial investigations showed spontaneous renal haemorrhage, for which an emergency partial nephrectomy was performed. Clinical, radiological, and pathological investigations suggested a diagnosis of testicular choriocarcinoma with metastases to the right kidney, both lungs, and brain. Initial treatment was with a chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin and whole brain radiotherapy; however, 6 months after diagnosis the patient developed liver metastasis, after which time the BEP protocol was switched to ITP with oral apatinib. Despite best efforts, the liver and lung metastasis continued to grow and a decision was made to discontinue active treatment and provide only palliative care until the patient passed away.Choriocarcinoma is a difficult cancer to diagnose pre-operatively. In male patients with early metastasis, prognosis may be much poorer than in the commoner gestational choriocarcinoma. A multidisciplinary with comprehensive post-surgical intervention is of great importance in the treatment of these patients.Platelets are needed to prevent or arrest bleeding and aggregate at the site of injury upon vascular damage. Platelets express receptors for estrogens which might affect the function of the platelets and their hemostatic ability. The aim was to identify possible differences in platelet function related to age, gender, and phases of the menstrual cycle by use of impedance aggregometry with Multiplate. In the first part of the study, platelet function was assessed in 60 healthy individuals (30 men and 30 women) in each of three age groups (20-25, 40-45, and 60-65 years). In the second part of the study, the platelet function was analyzed on four occasions during the menstrual cycle in women without oral contraceptives (OCs) (n = 17) and compared to 19 women on OCs and 18 men of similar age (20-40 years). For the women on OCs, aggregation was analyzed once during the tablet-free week and once late during the period with OCs. The men were sampled once. Women of younger age (<45 years) had significantly higher agonist-induced aggregation response than both men and post-menopausal women (60-65 years). The agonist-induced aggregation response did not differ between phases of the menstrual cycle or OC use. The results suggest that estradiol and/or progesterone affect spontaneous aggregation since it was found to be lowest in the mid-luteal phase. Spontaneous aggregation was significantly lower in women on OCs than in both men and women without OCs. Our findings indicate that fertile age is associated with higher aggregation response capacity of the platelets, possibly to prevent excessive bleeding during menstruation, but this response capacity is not altered during the menstrual cycle or by use of OCs.Visceral arterial pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs) are rare vascular entities with serious consequences. Traditionally, they are associated with trauma, infection, and inflammatory disease, or they can arise as a post-operative complication.An 87 year old man presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a spontaneous VAPA on a computed tomography angiogram. Serial imaging 4 months previously had demonstrated no aneurysm. Between scans, warfarin was changed to apixaban for aortic valve replacement, but he had no other changes to any other medications. He required urgent endovascular coiling of the pseudoaneurysm, with satisfactory recovery and outcome.VAPAs are extremely rare, with splenic artery VAPAs the most commonly reported. Regardless, fewer than 250 cases of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm have been reported. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) pseudoaneurysms are the rarest type of VAPAs. Early identification and urgent treatment are warranted because of the associated high mortality risk, with a 50% risk of rupture in any given VAPA. Treatment options range from open operation to endoscopic and endovascular procedures. Apixaban has been proposed to contribute to pseudoaneurysm formation by slow and continuous bleeding that results in the formation of the pseudoaneurysm.Spontaneous VAPAs are extremely rare and this is the first time a VAPA has been associated with the novel oral anticoagulant \"apixaban\". Urgent management of any VAPAs is important because of the high risk of rupture and potential life threatening haemorrhage.Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a common hemorrhagic small vessel disease of the brain, often associated with high risk of spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. When the suspicion of cerebral amyloid angiopathy is raised, clinicians are hesitant in prescribing oral anticoagulation in patients in whom it is otherwise indicated, including the case of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This is one of the thorniest clinical dilemmas in the field currently. In this short Leading Opinion piece by an international panel of clinicians-researchers active in the field, we present our consistent approach and future outlook on oral anticoagulation post intracerebral hemorrhage and in the setting of clinical-radiologic evidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We discuss recent advances and support a more balanced approach with implications for the wider neurological clinical community in regards to successful recruiting this patient population in ongoing and future randomized trials.Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban - are well established in terms of preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and high thromboembolism risk. When prescribed incorrectly, NOACs are associated with an increased risk of ischaemic events and bleeding. Current NOAC labels explicitly address dose adjustments according to age, body weight, renal function and concomitant treatment with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The required dose adjustments vary significantly from molecule to molecule, thereby creating a complex dose adjustment environment. Furthermore, recommendations support assessment of individual risk using thromboembolic and bleeding risk scores. Evidence-based medicine also provides data about specific patient profiles. In particular, some patients who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as patients on polymedication, are often at higher risk of stroke. More and more patients are being treated with NOACs. The question of appropriate dosing has become important, as studies are starting to show that reduced doses are being prescribed at very high rates. Although these data have not been evaluated in light of individual risk assessments, in everyday practice, physicians are often more concerned about drug-related bleeding than about the spontaneous evolution of the disease (stroke/systemic embolism), leading to high rates of prescription of inadequately low doses. Recent results have shown that only certain risk criteria justify dose reduction. Thus, the right dose needs to be prescribed for the right patient in order to obtain, in real-life practice, the benefits of NOACs that have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials.To determine the incidence of postoperative ascending infection without antibiotics with the use of a pediatric Foley catheter (PFC) after operative hysteroscopy for intrauterine pathology.",

        "annotations":"A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken in an academic medical setting. MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized clinical trials published up until August 2016. This search was supplemented by manual bibliography searches of identified trials and other review articles.Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were phase 3 randomized clinical trials, enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, compared a novel oral anticoagulant (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) with warfarin, and recorded event data on intraocular bleeding. Data on intraocular bleeding were pooled using inverse-variance, weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis.The PRISMA guidelines were used for abstracting data and assessing quality. Independent extraction was performed by 2 investigators.Intraocular bleeding events and associated risk ratio for novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin.Twelve trials investigating 102 627 patients were included. Randomization to novel oral anticoagulants was associated with a 22% relative reduction in intraocular bleeding compared with warfarin (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99). There was no significant heterogeneity observed (I2 = 4.8%, P = .40). Comparably lower risks of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants were seen in subgroup analyses, with no significant difference according to the indication for anticoagulation (P for heterogeneity = .49) or the novel oral anticoagulant type (P for heterogeneity = .15). Summary estimates did not differ materially when random-effects meta-analytic techniques were used.These results suggest that novel oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of intraocular bleeding by approximately one-fifth compared with warfarin. Similar benefits were seen in both patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Our data have particular relevance for patients at higher risk of spontaneous retinal and subretinal bleeding. These findings may also have important implications in the perioperative period, in which the use of novel oral anticoagulants may be superior. Future studies are required to better characterize the optimal management of patients with both ophthalmic disease and cardiovascular comorbidities requiring anticoagulation.Little is known about the potential safety issues associated with apixaban in clinical practice and their reporting in spontaneous adverse event (SAE) databases.To describe SAE reports associated with the oral anticoagulant apixaban from Australia, Canada and USA and to examine associated concomitant medicine use.SAE report databases from Australia, Canada and the USA were examined for all reports of adverse events associated with apixaban and concomitant medicines from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2014. Disproportionality analysis (proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and reporting odds ratio (ROR)) was conducted for the quantitative detection of signals using the USA database.There were 97 SAE reports associated with apixaban from Australia, 77 from Canada and 2877 from the USA. Reporting of haemorrhage (any type) was common, ranging from 18% for USA to 31% for Australia. Gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage was the most commonly reported haemorrhage, accounting for approximately 10% of adverse event reports across all countries. Positive signals were confirmed in the USA data (haemorrhage (any type) PRR, 12.1; A large proportion of adverse event reports for apixaban were associated with use of concomitant medicines which may have increased the risk of haemorrhage.Spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage accounts for up to a quarter of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage cases and is associated with higher hematoma volume and a worse outcome. Guidelines recommend rapid anticoagulant reversal but mode and timing are not specified and optimal strategy is uncertain. Variability in everyday practice is unknown.An invitation to a web-based survey was sent to 85 Dutch stroke neurologists in different hospitals, with questions about importance, timing, and medical management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage.In total, 61 (72%) neurologists completed the survey. Nearly all (97%) deemed rapid anticoagulant reversal important. A local guideline for management of anticoagulant reversal was used in 80% of the hospitals. Most neurologists (56%) estimated anticoagulant reversal in anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage to start later than intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Few (5%) thought it was quicker. A minority (28%) of the hospitals started anticoagulation reversal without waiting for laboratory test results or consulting a specialist in hemostasis. Prothrombin complex concentrate was used by all neurologists for vitamin K antagonist reversal and by most (74%) for reversal of thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors (72%). Anticoagulation reversal was initiated at the emergency department according to 89% of the respondents.Variability in logistics in acute management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage was demonstrated. Anticoagulant reversal is deemed important, but is estimated to have a longer door-to-needle time than alteplase in thrombolysis for ischemic stroke by most neurologists. Several delaying factors were found. These factors might have an impact on outcome.Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y A total of 14 963 patients treated with DAPT after coronary stenting-largely consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel and without indication to oral anticoagulation-were pooled at a single-patient level from eight multicentre randomised clinical trials with independent adjudication of events. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified predictors of out-of-hospital Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding stratified by trial, and developed a numerical bleeding risk score. The predictive performance of the novel score was assessed in the derivation cohort and validated in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial (n=8595) and BernPCI registry (n=6172). The novel score was assessed within patients randomised to different DAPT durations (n=10 081) to identify the effect on bleeding and ischaemia of a long (12-24 months) or short (3-6 months) treatment in relation to baseline bleeding risk.The PRECISE-DAPT score (age, creatinine clearance, haemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, and previous spontaneous bleeding) showed a c-index for out-of-hospital TIMI major or minor bleeding of 0·73 (95% CI 0·61-0·85) in the derivation cohort, and 0·70 (0·65-0·74) in the PLATO trial validation cohort and 0·66 (0·61-0·71) in the BernPCI registry validation cohort. A longer DAPT duration significantly increased bleeding in patients at high risk (score ≥25), but not in those with lower risk profiles The PRECISE-DAPT score is a simple five-item risk score, which provides a standardised tool for the prediction of out-of-hospital bleeding during DAPT. In the context of a comprehensive clinical evaluation process, this tool can support clinical decision making for treatment duration.None.Spontaneous non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. To improve the devastating course of ICH, various clinical trials for medical and surgical interventions have been conducted in the last 10 years. Recent large-scale clinical trials have reported that early intensive blood pressure reduction can be a safe and feasible strategy for ICH, and have suggested a safe target range for systolic blood pressure. While new medical therapies associated with warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have been developed to treat ICH, recent trials have not been able to demonstrate the overall beneficial effects of surgical intervention on mortality and functional outcomes. However, some patients with ICH may benefit from surgical management in specific clinical contexts and/or at specific times. Furthermore, clinical trials for minimally invasive surgical evacuation methods are ongoing and may provide positive evidence. Upon understanding the current guidelines for the management of ICH, clinicians can administer appropriate treatment and attempt to improve the clinical outcome of ICH. The purpose of this review is to help in the decision-making of the medical and surgical management of ICH.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase the risk for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an effect that is in theory linked to the strength of inhibition of serotonin reuptake of an antidepressant. However, whether antidepressants that are strong inhibitors of serotonin reuptake actually increase the risk for ICH and the effect of concomitant use of antithrombotics are unknown.To assess the risk for ICH associated with the use of SSRIs compared with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) among new users of antidepressants and according to the relative affinity of the antidepressant for the serotonin transporter and to assess whether concomitant use of antithrombotics modifies this risk.This population-based cohort study included new users of antidepressants 18 years or older from January 1, 1995, to June 30, 2014. More than 650 general practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink enrolled patients. with use of a nested case-control approach, each case of a first ICH identified during follow-up was matched with as many as 30 control individuals by age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. Follow-up was completed on October 31, 2014.Current use of SSRIs compared with TCAs and strong compared with weak serotonin reuptake inhibitors.Incidence rate ratios (RRs) of ICH.Among a cohort of 1 363 990 incident users of antidepressants (36.8% male; 63.2% female; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [18.5] years), 3036 cases of ICH were identified during follow-up and matched to 89 702 controls. Current SSRI use was associated with an increased risk for ICH (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.35) relative to TCAs, highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04-1.99), and translating in very few additional events. Similarly, the risk was increased by 25% with strong inhibitors (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.54) and highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.90-3.12). Concomitant use of anticoagulants may increase the risk substantially (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.89-3.39).The use of SSRIs and more generally of antidepressants with strong inhibition of serotonin reuptake are associated with an increased risk for ICH, particularly in the first 30 days of use and when used concomitantly with oral anticoagulants.Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), is probably the most common disease among heritable connective tissue disorders. It affects women more than men and causes symptoms in multiple organs. It is associated with chronic pain, skin fragility and abnormal bleeding. These characteristics may hamper reproductive life. We conducted a study to evaluate the gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in women with hEDS. We also explored a possible hormonal modulation of the hEDS symptoms. The gynecologic and obstetric history of 386 consecutive women diagnosed with hEDS was collected by a standardized questionnaire and a medical consultation performed by a senior gynecologist in an expert centre for hEDS between May 2012 and December 2014.We observed a high frequency of gynecologic complaints, specifically: menorrhagia (76 %), dysmenorrhea (72 %) and dyspareunia (43 %). Endometriosis was not highly prevalent in this population. The obstetric outcomes were similar to those of the general French population for deliveries by cesarean section (14.6 %) and premature births (6.2 %) but the incidence of multiple spontaneous abortion (13 %) and spontaneous abortion (28 %) were significantly higher. A subset of women were sensitive to hormonal fluctuations with more severe symptoms occurring during puberty, prior to menstruation, during the postpartum period as well as on oral contraception.Increased awareness of the gynecological symptomatology in women with hEDS can help discriminate between endometriosis and thus prevent useless, and potentially dangerous, surgery. This study also suggests that hormonal modulation may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of women with hEDS.We describe a case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, flank pain with nausea and no history of preceding trauma. The patient had finished a course of azithromycin and oral methylprednisolone 1 day prior to presentation. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan identified changes suggestive of bilateral adrenal haemorrhage. The patient did not show signs of acute adrenal insufficiency but was started on steroid replacement therapy because of concerns about possible disease progression. All recognised causes of adrenal haemorrhage were excluded suggesting this was a case of spontaneous idiopathic bilateral adrenal haemorrhage, a rarely reported phenomenon in the literature. The patient was discharged after clinical improvement following 6 days in hospital, taking oral steroid replacement.Opinions are divided regarding the management of a persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Some of the adverse effects associated with a large hemodynamically significant duct, including prolonged ventilation, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and mortality, indicate that active management of infants with large ductal shunts may sometimes be necessary. Indomethacin and ibuprofen are the two US FDA-approved cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors used for the closure of a ductus in preterm babies. Both these drugs are effective in 70-80% of extremely low birthweight infants. Treatment with COX inhibitors may be associated with renal impairment, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, NEC, and spontaneous intestinal perforation when given concurrently with steroids, as well as changes in cerebrovascular auto-regulation. Ibuprofen appears to be a better choice for PDA closure, with a better side effect profile and efficacy that equals that of indomethacin. However, long-term outcome studies of ibuprofen are lacking, and prophylactic ibuprofen is ineffective in decreasing severe IVH. The choice of one drug over the other also depends on local availability of both drugs and the intravenous or enteral preparation. The oral preparation of ibuprofen appears as effective as the intravenous preparation. The use of paracetamol to close a hemodynamically significant PDA has increased in recent years. Paracetamol also decreases prostacyclin synthesis; however, unlike COX inhibitors, it does not have a peripheral vaso-constrictive effect and can be given to infants with contraindications to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It appears to have similar efficacy based on limited data available from randomized trials. Until more data are available on efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes, it cannot be recommended as the first choice.Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disease that often affects children, but can also occur in adults and smokers. Oral manifestations are unusual and are characterized by bone pain, tooth mobility, necrotic ulcers and local edema. The aim of this paper is to describe a clinical case of LCH in an oral cavity that mimicked oral squamous cell carcinoma.",
