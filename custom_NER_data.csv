35785746,"""Haemophilia A"" - Presenting with oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis and management strategies.","Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder of coagulation that results in deficiency of factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or Factor IX (Hemophilia B) with characteristic X linked mode of inheritance, almost exclusively seen in males while females are asymptomatic carriers.The common clinical manifestation in both is prolonged bleeding on trivial trauma, mainly into larger joints or muscles. Life threatening bleeding episodes can result spontaneously or from trauma to the head or internal organs. Replacement of deficient clotting protein, known as Anti Hemophilic Factor (AHF) is the main stay in the treatment of haemophilia. Any Surgical treatment of these patients is to be planned in Institution hospital where comprehensive care is available. The availability of AHF has enabled surgeons to take up surgeries in patients with haemophilia. We discuss PWH with congenital factor VIII deficiency presented with oral squamous cell carcinoma of left side lower jaw with main aim is to provide insight into surgical management and care protocol of these patients."
35478183,Case-Control Study to Evaluate the Oral Hygiene Habits in 31 Children with Hemophilia in Bulgaria Using the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) Questionnaire.,"BACKGROUND For patients with hereditary coagulopathies such as hemophilia, the most common dental problem is spontaneous oral bleeding caused by daily oral hygiene habits like tooth brushing. Because of fear of bleeding, children with hemophilia often skip routine oral hygiene procedures, which can lead to dental caries and periodontal diseases. This case control study aimed to evaluate the oral hygiene awareness and hygiene practices of children with hemophilia from 6 to 18 years of age in Bulgaria. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was conducted over 4 years and included 31 patients (children). A sociological approach was used, with direct individual questionnaires for self-assessment of dental habits. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. RESULTS There was no significant difference between groups in methods of oral hygiene. The duration of oral hygiene procedures was 1 min (n=5, 16.13±6.61%) or 2 min (n=13, 41.94±8.86%), which was considered insufficient for proper oral hygiene. Children who had received oral hygiene advice by a dentist brushed their teeth significantly longer (n=9, 69.23±12.80%) than those who had not. There was a considerable difference between the reasons for the last dental visit between the groups of children (χ²=5.18, P."
34434677,A Case of Acquired Hemophilia A Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by antibodies against coagulation factor VIII. The majority of AHA cases are reported in an elderly population with chronic co-morbidities but can also be associated with other conditions, drugs, infections, and pregnancy. AHA is likely under-diagnosed and often unrecognized due to limited data about incidence, diagnosis, and management. We report a patient with no significant medical history who developed spontaneous ecchymoses and hematomas after a recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection complicated by a pulmonary embolism. These skin manifestations were initially thought to be related to the use of the direct oral anticoagulant apixaban, but further investigation revealed the presence of factor VIII inhibitors confirming the diagnosis of AHA. The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide to eradicate the inhibitors with excellent response. Literature review shows a few cases of AHA after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, H1N1 vaccination, and two cases after COVID-19 infection."
34423003,Current therapeutic approaches in the management of hemophilia-a consensus view by the Romanian Society of Hematology.,"Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are rare disorders, being caused by the total lack or under-expression of two factors from the coagulation cascade coded by genes of the X chromosome. Thus, in hemophilic patients, the blood does not clot properly. This results in spontaneous bleeding episodes after an injury or surgical intervention. A patient-centered regimen is considered optimal. Age, pharmacokinetics, bleeding phenotype, joint status, adherence, physical activity, personal goals are all factors that should be considered when individualizing therapy. In the past 10 years, many innovations in the diagnostic and treatment options were presented as being either approved or in development, thus helping clinicians to improve the standard-of-care for patients with hemophilia. Recombinant factors still remain the standard of care in hemophilia, however they pose a challenge to treatment adherence because they have short half-life, which where the extended half-life (EHL) factors come with the solution, increasing the half-life to 96 hours. Gene therapies have a promising future with proven beneficial effects in clinical trials. We present and critically analyze in the current manuscript the pros and cons of all the major discoveries in the diagnosis and treatment of HA and HB, as well as identify key areas of hemophilia research where improvements are needed."
33583426,Acquired hemophilia A that required surgical hemostasis of hematomas occupying oral cavity: a case report.,"Acquired hemophilia A is a rare coagulopathy caused by inhibitors of blood coagulation factor VIII. Patients with acquired hemophilia A have a higher mortality risk (5-10%) than those with congenital hemophilia. Moreover, there is no established evidence of management recommended for patients with acquired hemophilia A. Previous studies have reported the presence of hematomas in the oral cavities of patients with acquired hemophilia A, which were treated conservatively. Here, we describe the case of a patient with acquired hemophilia A, where emergency surgical hemostasis was required for large intraoral hematomas.
A 65-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of bleeding from large intraoral hematomas. On examination, he could not close his mouth because of the hematomas, which were bleeding spontaneously. Computed tomography angiography revealed no evidence of arteriovenous malformation, and blood test results showed that the activated partial thromboplastin time was elevated beyond the normal limit. To avoid a life-threatening hemorrhage from hematomas, emergency surgical hemostasis was performed with nasotracheal intubation using fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Hemostasis was successfully performed, as the hematomas were carefully removed. Moreover, the clinical course was successfully completed using intravenously administered activated prothrombin complex concentrate for hemostasis after operation.
Acquired hemophilia A can cause a life-threatening hemorrhage without predictive factors. Intraoral hematoma may cause airway obstruction. There is no consensus regarding the management of hemorrhage in patients with acquired hemophilia A. As shown here, exophytic hematomas in the oral cavity can be safely removed and nasotracheal intubation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be useful in patients with coagulopathy disease."
33390328,Evaluation of bleeding symptoms and laboratory parameters related to bleeding in sisters of patients with hemophilia A and B.,"Our purpose was to determine the bleeding risk of obligate and potential carriers, highlight the prophylactic applications before interventions for families and physicians.
Forty-six sisters who had at least one family member with hemophilia A or B were included. Laboratory parameters were tested.Bleeding tendency interrogated by a detailed questionnaire.The results were compared with 43 healthy female controls.
Mean factor activity levels were significantly lower in sisters than control subjects (p = 0,004). Bleeding score was higher in sisters than controls (p = 0.001). Prolonged bleeding after minor injury was significantly higher in the sisters than control subjects (p = 0.008). Requiring further treatment due to prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction was significantly higher in sisters (p = 0.001). Sisters had postpartum hemorrhage lasting longer than 6 weeks than controls (p = 0.025). Menstrual period lasted longer in the sisters than controls (p < 0.001). Spontaneous epistaxis, oral and gingival bleeding were more frequently observed in sisters whose factor activity levels were 60 % or below (p = 0.014 and p = 0.047, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the severity of hemophilia in the affected family member and the factor levels in the sisters (p = 0.398).Spontaneous epistaxis has found to be significantly associated with the hemophilia severity in the family (p = 0.004).
Clotting factor levels were found to be lower in the sisters and associated with spontaneous epistaxis, oral and gingival bleeding.Also, regardless of clotting factor levels, sisters significantly experienced more bleeding problems.Our study demonstrated the importance of taking precautions for prolonged bleeding in cases where medical interventions are inevitable in these patients."
33209799,Comparative analysis of oral health and treatment necessities in hemophilia individuals of Davangere population - A case control study.,"The integrated approach towards the oral care of individuals with special needs requires proper motivation and prophylactic guidance by primary health care professionals, including musculoskeletal support to psychological therapy. In developing countries like India, oral care is not of primary importance as oral hygiene practices are less performed by compromised individuals suffering from hemophilia. Here, primary health care professionals play a significant role. The present study was commenced to evaluate oral health and treatment necessities in hemophilic individuals of Davangere population, Karnataka.
The present study was conducted to assess and compare the oral hygiene, dentition status, and treatment needs of individuals with hemophilia.
Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), decayed, missed, filled tooth (DMFT) indices and treatment needs in 50 hemophiliac patients registered at Karnataka hemophilia society were evaluated along with an Oral health-related quality of life (OHR-QoL) questionnaire. They were matched with healthy controls of the same age and gender. The data was analyzed using t test and Chi square test.
The oral hygiene was fair in both hemophilic and healthy individuals with a mean value of 1.82 ± 0.79 and 1.83 ± 0.73, respectively. All the parameters such as OHIS, DMFT indices, and teatment needs were not statistically significant. The spontaneous oral bleeding was the only significant factor in OHR-Qol questionnaire.
The present study concluded that oral hygiene, dental caries prevalence, and treatment needs were similar in both hemophiliac and control groups. With proper guidance, motivation, and preventive care by primary health care professionals, it was relatively easy for individuals with congenital blood disorder (CBD) to maintain oral health-related quality of life in Davangere population, Karnataka."
32953190,Acquired Hemophilia A Presenting as Massive Postoperative Bleeding in a Patient with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is an extremely rare and serious bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Approximately, 10% of patients with AHA have an underlying malignancy. We report on a 46-year-old man with AHA and advanced oral cancer who presented with massive bleeding after surgery. Preoperative blood coagulation tests showed no abnormalities. He underwent radical tumor resection followed by reconstruction using a free rectus abdominal musculocutaneous flap. Massive subcutaneous hemorrhage developed in his neck and abdomen on the first postoperative day. The hemorrhage remained uncontrolled, despite embolization of the responsible vessels. Subsequent laboratory data showed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased FVIII levels. On the basis of his clinical course and the presence of the FVIII inhibitor, we speculated that the patient suffered from AHA. We administered recombinant activated factor VII and prednisolone, after which the spontaneous bleeding stopped and the subcutaneous hemorrhage resolved. A review of the literature identified only three previous documented cases of AHA associated with head and neck cancer. This case indicates that AHA should not be ruled out in patients with uncontrolled postoperative bleeding, while attempting to ensure bleeding control and preventing potentially catastrophic fatal consequences."
30904179,[Acquired autoimmune haemophilia: Where is the place of rituximab in the treatment strategy? Reflection from a monocentric series of 8 patients and literature review].,"Autoimmune acquired haemophilia is a rare autoimmune disease. The purpose of immunosuppressive therapy is to stop the production of autoantibodies that inhibit clotting factors VIII or IX. A corticosteroids-cyclophosphamide combination is recommanded as first-line therapy. From our experience at the University Hospital of Nîmes, we discuss the place of rituximab in the therapeutic arsenal.
We report a monocentric observational retrospective study. Our data are discussed in light of literature data, in particular cohorts EACH2 and SACHA.
Eight patients (7 with FVIII anibodies) were consecutively included from 2005. The average age was 68.5 years with a male predominance (62.5%). Bleeding manifestations were usually spontaneous and superficial. A pathology, mostly autoimmune or neoplastic, was associated in 5/8 patients. A ""by-pass"" haemostatic treatment was prescribed for 3/8 patients. Rituximab was prescribed for 5/8 patients, three times as first-line therapy, and always associated with corticosteroids. Three patients received a cyclophosphamid/cortisone combination, two were treated exclusively with oral corticosteroids. Remission was obtained in all patients, without subsequent relapse. The average time to obtain remission under rituximab (after the first injection) was 32.5 days (10-143). The results observed in our series of patients are consistent with the data from the literature.
Rituximab appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for autoimmune acquired haemophilia. However, its place remains to be specified."
29362165,Preoperative Detailed Coagulation Tests Are Required in Patients With Noonan Syndrome.,"Patients with Noonan syndrome often require surgery at young ages. They are at high risk of perioperative bleeding from coagulation defects that might not have been detected by routine screening. These risks are rarely described in the oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perioperative bleeding risks associated with Noonan syndrome and to propose preoperative guidelines.
This report describes a retrospective case series of patients with Noonan syndrome who underwent OMS procedures during a continuous observational period (2013 through 2016) in the authors' center. Clinical data, blood screening test results, and perioperative bleeding were analyzed.
Five patients (age, 4 to 20 yr) with Noonan syndrome who underwent OMS procedures were included in this study. One patient presented a spontaneous bleeding tendency (epistaxis requiring cauterization). Blood screening showed clotting defects in 3 patients. One patient presented abnormal perioperative bleeding owing to a mild defect in factor XI.
Patients with Noonan syndrome must be referred to a hematologist for specific preoperative investigations and for adapted perioperative management."
29126301,Coagulation Testing in the Core Laboratory.,"Primary hemostasis begins with endothelial injury. VWF, produced by endothelial cells, binds to platelets and links them to subendothelial collagen. Platelet-derived ADP and thromboxane activate non-adhered platelets via their GPIIb/IIIa receptors, allowing these platelets to participate in platelet aggregation. Secondary hemostasis is initiated with the binding of factor VII to extravascular tissue factor (TF). Factors II, VII, IX and X are vitamin K-dependent factors. The role of vitamin K is to assist in the addition of gamma carboxylate groups to glutamic acids in the ""GLA"" domains of these factors.In vitro the intrinsic pathway is initiated when fresh whole blood is placed in a glass tube. The negative charge of the glass initiates the ""contact pathway"" where FXII is activated and then FXIa cleaves FIX to FIXa. The extrinsic pathway is triggered when tissue factor, phospholipid and calcium are added to plasma anticoagulated with citrate. In vitro, FVII is activated to FVIIa, and TF-FVIIa preferentially converts FX to FXa activating the common pathway.The prothrombin time is commonly used to monitor warfarin anticoagulant therapy. To correct for differences in reagent and instrument, the international normalized ratio was developed to improve standardization of PT reporting globally. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to evaluate the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. The aPTT is useful clinically as a screening test for inherited and acquired factor deficiencies as well as to monitor unfractionated heparin therapy although the anti-Xa assay is now the preferred measure of the effects of unfractionated heparin. The Clauss assay is the most commonly performed fibrinogen assay and uses diluted plasma where clotting is initiated with a high concentration of reagent thrombin.The mixing study assists in the assessment of an abnormally prolonged PT or aPTT. An equal volume of citrated patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and the PT or aPTT are repeated on the 1:1 mix. Factor activity assays are most commonly performed as a one-stage assay. The patient's citrated plasma is diluted and mixed 1-to-1 with a single factor-deficient substrate plasma. A PT or aPTT is performed on the above mix, depending on the factor being tested.Factor inhibitors are antibodies that are most commonly diagnosed in male patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) where they are induced by factor replacement therapy.Factor inhibitors can also appear in the form of spontaneous autoantibodies in both male and female individuals who were previously well. This is an autoimmune condition called ""acquired hemophilia.""Most coagulation laboratories can measure the plasma concentration of VWF protein (VWF antigen) by an immunoturbidimetric technique. Testing the functional activity of VWF, utilizes the drug ristocetin.The state of multimerization of VWF is important and is assessed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. Type 2a and 2b VWD are associated with the lack of intermediate- and high molecular weight multimers.The antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is an acquired autoimmune phenomenon associated with an increased incidence of both venous and arterial thromboses, as well as fetal loss. Typically, there is a paradoxical prolongation of the aPTT in the absence of any clinical features of bleeding. This is the so-called ""lupus anticoagulant (LA) effect."" The laboratory definition of the APLS requires the presence of either a ""lupus anticoagulant"" or a persistent titer of antiphospholipid antibodies.There are now 2 broad classes of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs): [1] The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) such as dabigatran; and [2] The oral direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. The PT and aPTT are variably affected by the DOACs and are generally unhelpful in monitoring their concentrations. Most importantly, a normal PT or aPTT does NOT exclude the presence of any of the DOACs."
28341450,Oral Surgery in Patients With Glanzmann Thrombasthenia: A Case Series.,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a severe defect of platelet function caused by an inherited deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia experience lifelong spontaneous and post-traumatic mucocutaneous bleeding diathesis. Surgery is usually very challenging, requiring close cooperation among surgeons, hematologists, and anesthesiologists. For anatomic reasons, oral surgery is particularly difficult owing to the inherent risk of hemorrhage and the difficulty in achieving local hemostasis. In the present report, we describe 3 successful cases of oral surgery in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia and report the surgical and hematologic management of each case."
27919470,Spontaneous sublingual haematoma in acquired haemophilia: case report.,"Acquired haemophilia is a rare disease in which bleeding is more severe than in hereditary haemophilia and usually occurs in the soft tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, or the mucous membranes. There have been only a few presentations of spontaneous sublingual haematoma in acquired haemophilia, but prompt management of the airway and identification of the underlying cause was crucial in all."
27813214,Complications of haemophilia in babies (first two years of life): a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Universal Data Collection System.,"To describe the prevalence and complications in babies ≤2 years with haemophilia.
We used a standardized collection tool to obtain consented data on eligible babies aged ≤2 years with haemophilia enrolled in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Universal Data Collection System surveillance project at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs).
Of 547 babies, 82% had haemophilia A, and 70% were diagnosed within one month of birth. Diagnosis was prompted by known maternal carrier status (40%), positive family history (23%), bleeding (35%) and unknown 2%; 81% bled during the first two years. The most common events were bleeding (circumcision, soft tissue, oral bleeding) and head injury. There were 46 episodes of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in 37 babies (7%): 18 spontaneous, 14 delivery related, 11 traumatic, 2 procedure related and 1 unknown cause. Of the 176 central venous access devices (CVADs) in 148 (27%) babies, there were 137 ports, 22 surgically inserted central catheters and 20 peripherally inserted central catheters. Ports had the lowest complication rates. Inhibitors occurred in 109 (20%) babies who experienced higher rates of ICH (14% vs. 5%; P = 0.002), CVAD placement (61% vs. 19%; P < 0.001) and CVAD complications (44% vs. 26%; P < 0.001). The most common replacement therapy was recombinant clotting factor concentrates.
Bleeding events in haemophilic babies ≤2 years were common; no detectable difference in the rates of ICH by the mode of delivery was noted. Neonatal factor exposure did not affect the inhibitor rates. Minor head trauma, soft tissue and oropharyngeal bleeding were the leading indications for treatment."
26440491,A Case of Acute Upper Airway Obstruction in a Pediatric Hemophilia A Patient Because of Spontaneous Retropharyngeal Hemorrhage.,"We report a rare case of acute upper airway obstruction caused by spontaneous retropharyngeal hemorrhage as a result of hemophilia A in a 16-year-old pediatric patient who routinely received factor VIII replacement. Initial diagnosis was delayed because the patient presented with symptoms, such as throat pain and odynophagia, similar to those of common benign upper airway infections. Within 2 days of the initial presentation of symptoms, the patient went into respiratory failure as a result of retropharyngeal hemorrhage. The possibility of spontaneous retropharyngeal or epiglottic hemorrhage or hematoma should be considered as a cause of rapidly progressing odynophagia and dyspnea by hemophilia patients."
25547669,Acquired haemophilia A associated with autoimmune thyroiditis: a case report.,"Acquired haemophilia A is a rare life- and limb-threatening bleeding disorder if left untreated. Autoimmune thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that can be rarely associated with acquired haemophilia. Here we report a case of a 60-year-old woman presenting with cutaneous and muscle haematomas secondary to acquired haemophilia A in association with autoimmune thyroiditis, who was successfully treated with recombinant activated factor VII and immunosuppression.
A 60-year-old Sri Lankan woman with a background of longstanding hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and bronchial asthma developed spontaneous cutaneous purpura and a limb-threatening intramuscular haematoma. Initial coagulation screening revealed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time of 66.4 seconds (normal range 26 to -36 seconds) and time-dependent inhibitors against factor VIII. She had positive antinuclear antibody and antithyroid peroxidase (microsomal) antibody titre of over 1/80 and 1000IU/mL respectively. The diagnosis was therefore made of acquired haemophilia A in association with autoimmune thyroiditis. Acute limb-threatening bleeding was managed with recombinant activated factor VII (NovoSeven®). Immunosuppressive treatment consisting of oral prednisone 60mg/day and cyclophosphamide 100mg/day was administered in order to remove the factor VIII inhibitor. This treatment led to normalisation of her haemostatic parameters. This case illustrates a very rare association of acquired haemophilia and autoimmune thyroiditis as well as the importance of considering acquired haemophilia as a differential diagnosis of spontaneous bleeding.
Acquired haemophilia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained bleeding in adults. Treatment of the acute coagulopathy with recombinant activated factor VII and immunosuppressive therapy was successful in this case."
22726101,Treatment of inherited platelet disorders.,"For patients affected by severe inherited platelet dysfunctions, e.g. Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) or Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), platelet transfusion is frequently needed for controlling spontaneous bleeding, and is always needed when trauma occurs or surgery is performed. For the mild-to-moderate bleeding entities, e.g. storage pool disease, thrombaxane A2 receptor defect, platelet transfusion is usually unnecessary. Transfusion of platelets should be used selectively and sparingly because of the substantial risk of alloimmunization against HLA antigens and/or platelet glycoproteins (GP) αIIb, β(3), or αIIbβ(3) in GT, and GPI-IX-V in BSS, which may lead to refractoriness to therapy. To reduce the risk, HLA-matched single donors of platelets should be used. If such donors are unavailable, leucocyte-depleted blood components should be used. Therapy other than platelet transfusion includes: (i) Prevention (vaccination against hepatitis B, avoidance of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, preservation of dental hygiene, correction of iron deficiency and prenatal diagnosis). (ii) Topical measures (compression with gauze soaked with tranexamic acid, fibrin sealants, splints for dental extractions and packing for nose bleeds). (iii) Antifibrinolytic agents that are useful for minor surgery and as adjuncts for other treatment modalities. (iv) Desmopressin that increases plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII giving rise to increased platelet adhesiveness and aggregation associated with shortened bleeding time. (v) Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). GT patients have been treated for bleeding episodes by rFVIIa with partial success. The mechanism by which rFVIIa arrests bleeding is probably related to increased thrombin generation by a tissue factor-independent process, enhanced platelet adhesion and restoration of platelet aggregation. (vi) Female hormones. Excessive bleeding during menarche in patients with GT or BSS can be controlled by high doses of oestrogen followed by high doses of oral oestrogen-progestin. Menorrhagia later in life can be managed by continuous oral contraceptives. Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate administered every 3 months is an alternative when combined oral contraceptives are contraindicated."
22048588,Orofacial manifestations of hematological disorders: anemia and hemostatic disorders.,"The aim of this paper is to review the literature and identify orofacial manifestations of hematological diseases, with particular reference to anemias and disorders of hemostasis. A computerized literature search using MEDLINE was conducted for published articles on orofacial manifestations of hematological diseases, with emphasis on anemia. Mesh phrases used in the search were: oral diseases AND anaemia; orofacial diseases AND anaemia; orofacial lesions AND anaemia; orofacial manifestations AND disorders of haemostasis. The Boolean operator ""AND"" was used to combine and narrow the searches. Anemic disorders associated with orofacial signs and symptoms include iron deficiency anemia, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, megaloblastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassaemia and aplastic anemia. The manifestations include conjunctiva and facial pallor, atrophic glossitis, angular stomatitis, dysphagia, magenta tongue, midfacial overgrowth, osteoclerosis, osteomyelitis and paraesthesia/anesthesia of the mental nerve. Orofacial petechiae, conjunctivae hemorrhage, nose-bleeding, spontaneous and post-traumatic gingival hemorrhage and prolonged post-extraction bleeding are common orofacial manifestations of inherited hemostatic disorders such as von Willebrand's disease and hemophilia. A wide array of anemic and hemostatic disorders encountered in internal medicine has manifestations in the oral cavity and the facial region. Most of these manifestations are non-specific, but should alert the hematologist and the dental surgeon to the possibilities of a concurrent disease of hemopoiesis or hemostasis or a latent one that may subsequently manifest itself."
21412135,Acquired factor VIII inhibitor as initial manifestation of collagen vascular disease: response to combination immunosuppression as first-line therapy.,"Acquired hemophilia A is a rare disorder caused by the development of inhibitors to coagulation factor VIII. The case of a 74-year-old man who presented with spontaneous ecchymoses and was found to have acquired hemophilia A is reported. Bleeding was acutely controlled using recombinant activated factor VII. Combined modality immunosuppression was promptly initiated using intravenous methylprednisolone (later converted to oral prednisone), cyclophosphamide and rituximab. By day 17, inhibitor titer had decreased from 8.5 Bethesda units/mL to 1.3 units/mL and was subsequently undetectable; by day 26, factor VIII activity had increased from less than 1% to 42% and was greater than 100% by day 43. All treatment had concluded by day 40. Reported cases of the use of rituximab for acquired hemophilia in the elderly were reviewed. The use of rituximab as part of a combined immunosuppression regimen is an effective first-line approach to acquired hemophilia."
21264446,Bleeding tendency and efficacy of anti-haemorrhagic treatments in patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease and increased von Willebrand factor clearance.,"Accelerated clearance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) has been recently identified as a major pathophysiologic mechanism inducing low VWF in some patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD). The frequency of bleeding and the best treatment of these patients have never been evaluated prospectively in large series of patients. It was the aim of the present study to prospectively evaluate clinical events of 60 heterozygous patients with VWD Vicenza (VWD-VI) carrying R1205H VWF mutation and 23 with C1130F mutation, both characterised by markedly increased VWF clearance. During 71 months of follow-up, 65% of patients with VWD-VI and 61% with C1130F required treatment. The rate of spontaneous bleeding requiring consultation/treatment was 7.5/100 patients-year in patients with C1130F mutation vs. 1.9/100 patients-year in those with R1205H (p=0.004). This difference persisted also by multivariate analysis adjusted for sex, age and blood group (hazard ratio [HR]=3.3 for C1130F, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-9.27) and females were at greater risk of bleeding (HR=3, 95%CI 1.01-9.93) because of menorrhagia. Only 3/15 (20 %) women in fertile age with VWD-VI compared to 8/9 (89 %) with C1130F mutation required consultation/treatment for menorrhagia (iron supplementation, combined oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid). Almost all dental extractions, minor surgeries and deliveries occurring during follow-up were successfully managed with desmopressin. Major surgery required factor VIII/VWF concentrates, but a few cases benefited from desmopressin. In conclusion, similar to patients with type 1 VWD, also in patients with increased VWF clearance desmopressin maintains a major therapeutic role."
21042682,[Rituximab in the treatment of acquired haemophilia A in a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica].,"Acquired hemophilia A is a rare but potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder. It is caused by the development of autoantibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII in adults or elderly patients, who do not have a personal or family history of bleeding.
A man (age: 76 years) on prednisone and leflunomide for polymyalgia rheumatica developed spontaneous severe haematomas. The patient was diagnosed with acquired factor VIII deficiency (FVIII activity 1.2%, FVIII inhibitor 31.7 BU). Due to the active bleeding diathesis, treatment was administered with activated prothrombin complex concentrates (FEIBA&reg;, Baxter). Immunosuppressive treatment with a combination of oral prednisone (1 mg/kg daily) and cyclophosphamide (1,5 mg/kg daily) was administered to reduce the FVIII inhibitor. However, after two weeks of treatment, FVIII was only 3% and no clinical improvement was observed. Treatment with the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab intravenously at 375 mg/m2 once weekly for four consecutive weeks was started. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement following rituximab treatment. He achieved a complete remission defined as return to normal FVIII activity and undetectable FVIII inhibitor titer. After a follow-up of six months no relapse occurred.
Rituximab appears an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with acquired haemophilia."
20583237,Airway obstruction and hemophilia-A: epiglottis hematoma.,Acute upper airway obstruction is a potentially life-threatening event. Hemophilia-A is a coagulopathy with high risk for spontaneous bleeding. Here we describe for the first time a spontaneous epiglottic internal hemorrhage leading to upper airway narrowing in a hemophilia-A patient. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for airway observation and treatment with factor VIII supplementation. In the first 48 hours there was rapid respiratory improvement. The epiglottic swelling resolved on the 5th day. In this patient no oral intubation or surgical management was needed.
20163836,Future directions in hemostasis: normalizing the lives of patients with hemophilia.,"The ultimate goal of hemophilia research is to cure the disease by permanently replacing the abnormal or deficient clotting factor. The most promising current approach is to insert a functional gene into the patient that will lead to the production of either the native protein or a compatible non-immunogenic equivalent version. This protein will circulate at adequate levels to prevent spontaneous bleeds and to treat traumatic hemorrhage. While there continues to be progress in this area, there remain significant hurdles to allow the process to be done at minimal risk to the patient. In the short term the goals are: 1) to prevent spontaneous bleeding whenever possible through the provision of effective prophylactic therapy, and 2) to rapidly establish hemostasis when bleeding occurs via effective, safe and widely available treatment modalities. In addition, all therapy should be convenient and simple to use so as to allow the vast majority of hemophilia patients to routinely treat themselves. Optimally, such treatment should not require highly trained medical personnel or vascular access. Prophylactic therapy will be facilitated via the development and introduction of clotting factors with prolonged circulating times. Long acting versions of rFVIIa, rFVIII and rFIX are either already in or are about to enter clinical trials. Rapid treatment of bleeding could be facilitated by bio-engineered molecules with increased activity and/or altered binding characteristics. At least one such agent is in phase II clinical trials. Ease of administration may be accomplished by the introduction of room temperature stable products and the development of subcutaneous and even orally administered therapeutics. It is conceivable that a broad spectrum hemostatic agent capable of normalizing thrombin generation in a variety of deficiencies could be developed. If this is accomplished, the steps to a room temperature stable agent, contained within a pre-filled pen, capable of self-delivery by subcutaneous injection are already within the realm of current developmental capabilities."
19251406,Pulmonary hemorrhage: A novel mode of therapy.,"Major hemoptysis a potentially life-threatening condition in pulmonology and can originate from both identifiable and unidentifiable sites. Identifiable bleeding sites can be controlled locally by iced saline, vasopressors, laser, electrocautery and balloon tamponade. Bleeding from an unidentifiable source, on the other hand, is much more difficult to control as the bleeding site is not accessible by the bronchoscope. Tranexamic acid (TA), a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent, is approved for treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in hemophilia or following major operative procedures via intravenous or oral routes. Its efficacy in controlling bleeding from mucosal tissue led us to apply it to patients with pulmonary bleeding. Six patients with significant hemoptysis, two who bled during bronchoscopy biopsy and four with spontaneous bleeding (lung cancer, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, idiopathic pulmonary bleeding, metastatic thyroid carcinoma) were treated with TA. For the two who bled during bronchoscopy, we used a bolus of 500mg/5mL through the bronchoscope working channel, while the latter four received aerosolized TA 500mg/5ml 3-4 times a day. In all cases, the bleeding stopped with the first dose of TA, and the treatment was well tolerated without adverse events. While limited due to the small number of patients, these data show that TA administered either as a bolus through the bronchoscope or via inhalation seems to be effective in controlling severe hemoptysis from both identifiable and unidentifiable bleeding sites. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of the TA in this set-up."
19144654,Effective hemostasis during minor surgery in a case of hereditary combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.,"Combined deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (VKCFD) is a rare bleeding disorder involving defective gamma-carboxylation of coagulation factors II , VII, IX and X as well as natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S. The disease is characterized by a cluster of different, often life threatening, bleeding symptoms occurring both spontaneously and in a surgical setting. In the present paper we describe two different treatment modalities to be used both in a programmed surgical procedure and in an emergency scenario. As this disease is a natural model that resembles oral anticoagulation, our experience discloses a possible rationale in the use of recombinant activated FVII for warfarin reversal."
18575423,Acquired hemophilia: a case report.,"Acquired hemophilia is a severe bleeding diathesis that affects both males and females. It is caused by suddenly appearing autoantibodies that interfere with coagulation factor VIII activity. This disorder is characterized by spontaneous and post-traumatic subcutaneous bleeds and massive mucosal hemorrhages. We report in the current article a case of acute renal failure and bleeding from the urinary tract caused by idiopathic acquired hemophilia in a 54-year-old woman. Hemostatic tests indicated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to 107.8 sec (norm 26-36 sec), normal value of the prothrombin index which was 82% (norm 70-130%), increased fibrinogen concentration to 583 mg/dl (normal value 200-400 mg/dl), the bleeding time was 5 min and 20 s (norm < 10 min) and the platelet count was 366 x 10(9)/l (norm 130-400 x10(9)/l). The autoantibody against factor VIII in a titer of 121 Bethesda Units/ml (BU/ml) and decreased factor VIII activity to 2% (norm 50-150%) with normal plasma concentration of factor IX. Activated (FEIBA, Baxter) and nonactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (factor IX concentrate) have been used in the treatment of bleeding episode. Immunosuppressive treatment with the combination of oral prednisone 60 mg/24h and cyclophosphamide 150 mg/24h was administered in order to remove the factor VIII inhibitor. Reduction of the factor VIII inhibitor titer to 38 BU/ml and increase of factor VIII activity to 4% was initially achieved. This treatment has been continued for two years and led to normalization of hemostatic parameters (APTT 26 sec, factor VIII activity 108%) which means a total removal of factor VIII inhibitor."
18551353,Acquired hemophilia in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and literature review.,"We report the case of a 38-year-old female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed acquired hemophilia caused by factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors. She manifested spontaneous bleeding symptoms such as ecchymoses and hematuria. Laboratory findings showed an isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time, reduced FVIII activity, and a high titer of FVIII inhibitors. She was successfully treated with oral predonisolone and cyclosporine in combination with steroid and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy."
17662215,[Spontaneous intramural small bowel hemorrhage: an event on the increase].,"Spontaneous intramural intestinal hemorrhage is highly infrequent. The most common cause is overdose of oral anticoagulants. Clinical presentation usually consists of abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. The diagnostic imaging technique of choice is computed tomography. Spontaneous intramural intestinal hemorrhage usually resolves spontaneously and consequently the treatment of choice is non-operative. Surgery is reserved for complicated processes or when the diagnosis is uncertain. We present two cases. The first was due to overanticoagulation by acenocoumarol, and the second was an exceptional complication in a hemophiliac patient."
17483755,[Bullous pemphigoid and acquired hemophilia].,"Acquired hemophilia is a rare disease. Associated pemphigoid is extremely uncommon. We report a case of acquired hemophilia in the course of this dermatosis illustrating the severity of the disease.
An 83 year-old woman was followed for 3 years for pemphigoid treated with topical corticosteroids following a recent relapse. She was hospitalized for surgical treatment of extensive and painful hematoma of the anterior aspect of the right leg following a fall. Preoperative clotting tests showed an extremely long cephalin coagulation time (> 2 x normal) not corrected by addition of control plasma, with a normal prothrombin time, due to acquired hemophilia type A and the presence of factor VIII inhibitor (17 Bethesda units/ml). The coagulant activity of factor VIII was reduced by 3%. The patient was treated with recombinant human factor VII (NovoSeven) and systemic corticosteroids were subsequently administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d to ensure direct action on antibody production. Seven days later, the patient presented intense abdominal pain and extension deficit in the right lower limb. An abdominal-pelvic scan revealed spontaneous hematoma of the right psoas-iliac muscle. Despite replacement therapy with NovoSeven and oral corticosteroids, worsening of the hematoma occurred, complicated by hemorrhagic shock, resulting in death.
Acquired hemophilia, as revealed by cutaneous-mucosal bleeding, is a rare disease (1 to 4 cases per million subjects) more commonly seen in adults. It is associated with the presence of antibodies directed against factor VIII. Its complications, particularly hemorrhagic, are fatal in 15 to 20% of cases. While acquired hemophilia seems to occur in isolation in one of every two cases, it may be associated with autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative syndromes, solid tumors, the post-partum period, or use of certain drugs. In dermatology, acquired hemophilia has been reported in association with pemphigoid (9 cases), in which case the prognosis is consistently very poor, with pemphigus vulgaris (5 cases), more recently with acquired epidermolysis bullosa (3 cases), and finally with mucosal pemphigoid (1 case).
Given the severity of associated hemorrhagic accidents, early identification of this clotting disorder is warranted in order to allow initiation of treatment as soon as possible."
17212732,Haemoperitoneum associated with ovulation in women with bleeding disorders: the case for conservative management and the role of the contraceptive pill.,"Haemoperitoneum secondary to ruptured corpus luteum is a rare complication for women on anticoagulants and with certain congenital bleeding disorders. A surgical approach is often taken, leading to oophorectomy in many cases. We describe three patients presenting with haemoperitoneum in association with factor VII deficiency, factor X deficiency and sitosterolaemia. In two of the patients, recurrent episodes occurred prior to introduction of the oral contraceptive pill. Conservative management with blood product and factor concentrate support was successful in avoiding surgery in three of the five episodes of bleeding. These cases demonstrate that preservation of ovarian function is possible with a conservative approach and recurrent episodes may be prevented by suppression of ovulation."
17021545,"Use of recombinant factor VIIa, Novo Seven, in the management of acute haemorrhage.","The purpose of this paper is to propose the use of factor VIIa in treating severely bleeding patients.
Recombinant factor VIIa was developed in 1988 to treat patients with haemophilia A or B and antibodies against factors VIII and IX, or patients with a spontaneous inhibitor against factors VIII and IX. Since then factor VIIa has been shown to be very effective in treating many other bleeding disorders, such as diverse thrombocytopathias, antibodies against other coagulation proteins like factor V, and bleeding as a result of oral anticoagulation.
Recombinant factor VIIa may be the universal haemostatic agent, but further studies are needed to prove this."
16834741,Periodontal status and IOTN interventions among young hemophiliacs.,"Fifty-two young individuals suffering from severe haemophilia A and B volunteered to be compared with school- and college-going students for oral health status description and subsequent management. A total of 244 students (84.42% boys and 15.58% girls) with the age group of 13-23 years were divided into two groups, A and B (controls). The purpose of this study was to increase awareness about evidence-based dental practices by oral examinations followed by comparisons of periodontal health and prevalence of malocclusions among medically compromised students and healthy controls. Results described the oral health in severe haemophilic population to be compromised with combined simplified health index score of 0.50 and Decayed/Modified/Filled Teeth (DMFT) index score of 2.07 when compared with 0.42 and 0.95, respectively, among group B. Although prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among group A were higher, yet it was not confirmed as a reason for degraded dental and periodontal status. However, spontaneous and/or toothbrush (trauma)-induced gingival bleeding episodes among group A could be explained as factors discouraging oral hygiene maintenance, particularly self-administered measures. Four haemophiliacs presented with symptoms of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome (TMPDS). Evidence-based oral medicine and clinical practices need to be encouraged and applied to enhance the quality of life among haemophiliacs, particularly in developing world. Dental treatment needs of haemophilic population appear to be greater and maybe incorporated in routine dental practices, at institutional and individual levels."
16715966,[Ischemic colitis following the treatment of acute hemorrhage in a patient with acquired hemophilia A].,"A 66-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia developed a hemorrhagic stomal ulcer and massive hematoma of the face at 4 and 7 months, respectively, after fundusectomy for early gastric cancer. The diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A was made based on the marked prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time, an extremely low factor VIII activity, and a very high-titer factor VIII inhibitor. After admission, oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide were started. In addition, activated prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant activated factor VII were intravenously administered which successfully controlled his hemorrhage. Only 1 week after the episode of bleeding, however, he complained of abdominal pain accompanied by watery stool with fresh blood. The diagnosis of ischemic colitis was made based on the clinical course and the findings on both CT-scan and colon fiberoscopy. The colitis spontaneously and quickly resolved with conservative observation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ischemic colitis that occurred in an acquired hemophilia patient without simultaneous administration of coagulation factors or antifibrinolytic agents. We should thus pay attention to the possible occurrence of thrombotic events even in acquired hemophilia patients in the presence of risk factors for thrombosis."

15763970,Recombinant activated factor VII in patients at high risk of bleeding.,"Currently, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (NovoSeven) is indicated for the treatment of spontaneous and surgical bleeding in congenital haemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors to factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX) >5 Bethesda units (BU) worldwide, and in patients with acquired haemophilia, congenital FVII deficiency and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia in Europe. Until April 2003, almost three-quarters of a milion doses of rFVIIa have been administered proving its efficacy and excellent safety record. According to results from initial clinical trials and a large number of case reports, the rFVIIa may be effective not only in treating haemophilia patients but also in treatment of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulation or heparin, patients with liver diseases, von Willebrand disease (vWD), thrombocytopenia, various platelet defects, congenital or acquired deficiency of FVII, and in subjects without any pre-existing coagulopathy with diffuse life-threatening bleeding triggered by surgery or trauma. This review will briefly summarize rFVIIa mode of action in haemostasis, the current clinical experience with rFVIIa and focus on the alternative use of rFVIIa in patients at the high risk of bleeding in both spontaneous cases and clinical trials reports."
15562920,Morbidity and economic complications following mucogingival surgery in a hemophiliac HIV-infected patient: a case report.,"This report describes the surgical treatment of a gingival recession in a hemophiliac HIV-infected patient. To our knowledge, mucogingival surgery has not been described previously in these patients.
Under the supervision of the patient's hematologist, a subepithelial connective tissue graft procedure was carried out to treat the recession. The treatment was performed after substitution therapy with factor VIII concentrate, supported by local antifibrinolytic treatment with epsilonaminocaproic acid.
One week after surgery, the grafted zone showed a normal healing, but an area of necrosis appeared at the donor palatal site with spontaneous bleeding. The administration of factor VIII concentrate had to be prolonged to arrest the hemorrhage. In total, 44,500 units of factor VIII concentrate were used, the cost of which reached around $20,000. After 1 month the donor site had re-epithelialized by secondary intention. The root coverage was around 85% successful.
Because of the surgical risk and the high economic cost in the use of the factor VIII concentrate, we do not recommend performing mucogingival surgery in HIV-infected hemophiliacs unless it is absolutely necessary. Prevention and early treatment must be the goal in the management of these patients."

9798303,Acquired hemophilia A: report of two cases.,"Two patients who presented with active bleeding and were diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A (AHA) are reported herein. One was a 27-year-old woman who experienced spontaneous oozing from an episiotomy wound six days after her second normal delivery. Bleeding became progressively worse, despite treatment with primary sutures and curettage of the uterus at a local hospital. She underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy because of intra-abdominal bleeding, during which perforations of the uterus were discovered. Unremitting bleeding from the surgical wound occurred after surgery. The patient was finally diagnosed with AHA when Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor (titer, 19 Bethesda units (BU)/ml) was detected in her plasma. She died of refractory hemorrhaging, despite intensive treatment with Factor IX concentrate infusion and cyclophosphamide therapy. The second patient was a 22-year-old man who sustained spontaneous and recurrent intramuscular hemorrhage in the right thigh for one month. Laboratory studies including complete blood count, biochemical evaluation, coagulation screening and immunologic assays were all within normal limits, except for a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Idiopathic AHA was diagnosed after the detection of plasma FVIII inhibitor with a concentration of 5.9 BU/ml. The patient's coagulopathy was successfully managed with plasma exchange and subsequent treatment with oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide."

A clinical, biological and therapeutic approach].","Haemorrhages in the upper aero-digestive tract, whether spontaneous or provoked by surgery, lead to the discovery of abnormal coagulation. A retrospective series of 43 children hospitalized for haemorrhage of the upper aero-digestive tract enabled us to evaluate the most frequent causes. Willebrand's disease, haemophilia and Glanzmann's thromboasthenia, primary haemostasis disease, made up 27.9% of the cases; acquired impaired haemostasis by thrombopathies secondary to aspirin intake accounted for 25.6%; finally the haemostasis tests were normal in 46.5% of the children. Based on clinical features and biological data, we proposed an adapted diagnostic approach and discussed therapy in light of the current literature. This study confirmed the importance of an adapted routine battery of laboratory tests and the persistent search for impaired haemostasis in children hospitalized for haemorrhage of the upper aero-digestive tract."
1609771,"Bleeding tendency, platelet function, and pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen and zidovudine in HIV(+) hemophilic men.","The use of ibuprofen (IBP) in hemophilic men for chronic hemophilic arthropathy is associated with transient coagulation abnormalities, but usually does not cause bleeding symptoms. However, when hemophilic men are treated with ibuprofen while also receiving zidovudine (ZDV), excess bleeding has occurred in some. In order to evaluate platelet function and pharmacokinetics of combination IBP and ZDV, we measured platelet aggregation, platelet adhesive index, bleeding time, and IBP and ZDV drug levels by high performance liquid chromatography on five patients receiving chronic oral IBP, 400 mg every 6 hr, and on ten patients receiving both IBP and ZDV, 100 or 200 mg every 4 hr five times daily. Samples were obtained at baseline (ZDV alone), acutely (IBP+ZDV acutely), and chronically (2 weeks on IBP and ZDV). Abnormal platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid occurred in four of five (80%) of those receiving IBP alone and in 7 of 10 (70%) at baseline, 9 of 10 (90%) at acute, and 8 of 10 (80%) at chronic IBP and ZDV treatment, most commonly at 2 hr following dosing, when peak IBP levels occurred, and persisting 4 hr in those on chronic dosing. Half or more of those on combination IBP+ZDV showed a lowered platelet adhesive index and/or prolonged bleeding time. Excess bleeding symptoms occurred in three on chronic combination IBP+ZDV, two with increased frequency of spontaneous hemorrhages, and one with prolonged traumatic bleeding. Bleeding tendency was unrelated to the degree of platelet function abnormality, to peak drug levels of IBP or ZDV, or degree of liver function abnormality (SGPT). The clearance of IBP alone and ZDV alone were not different from the clearance of combination IBP and ZDV. Caution is urged regarding potential enhanced bleeding tendency in hemophiliacs receiving both IBP and ZDV in combination."

Case reports.,"The follicle ruptures at the time of ovulation and fills with blood, forming a corpus hemorrhagicum. Minor bleeding from the follicle into the abdominal cavity may cause peritoneal irritation and, when it occurs in a patient with a defect of primary hemostasis, hemoperitoneum can occur. Von Willebrand disease and afibrinogenemia are two important bleeding disorders in which both primary hemostasis and coagulation are involved. Bleeding during ovulation is one major clinical complication in women with these disease. We have studied three patients with this hemorrhagic complication.

In blood platelets, this leads to a lack of thromboxane synthesis comparable to the congenital defect which is known to be associated with enhanced bleeding tendency, although the bleeding time may not be prolonged. The four NSAID diclofenac, acemetacin, ibuprofen, and mefenamic acid administered to healthy volunteers at the recommended dosage led to significant suppression of thromboxane synthesis; this effect was more pronounced with acemetacin and ibuprofen than with diclofenac. After intake of NSAID enhanced bleeding during surgery must be expected; in individuals with additional impairment of the hemostatic system (i.e. treatment with oral anticoagulants, mild haemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, mild thrombocytopenia), spontaneous bleeding may occur."
1825867,Pseudopathologies of hemostasis and dental surgery.,"Values of hemostasis tests are grossly abnormal in persons with factor XII deficiency, dysfibrinogenemia, the lupuslike anticoagulant, and pseudothrombocytopenia, yet these persons do not usually bleed spontaneously or even after surgery. We reviewed the records of 66 patients with laboratory diagnosis of one of the aforementioned abnormalities to determine whether they bled excessively after challenges to hemostasis such as dental extractions. Only three of them bled excessively, but two of these had other concomitant causes that could explain bleeding. Hence the dentist should not give up dental extractions or other surgical procedures when results of hemostasis tests are grossly abnormal, because these are not necessarily associated with abnormal hemostasis. Obviously, the correct interpretation of abnormal hemostasis values warrants close collaboration and reciprocal consultation between the dentist and the hematologist."
2310826,Hemorrhagic sequelae of immune thrombocytopenic purpura in human immunodeficiency virus-infected hemophiliacs.,"Clinical bleeding tendency and tests of immune function were studied prospectively in 11 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected hemophiliacs with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and a platelet count less than 50,000/microL. These 11 patients represented 13% of a well-characterized cohort of 87 HIV + hemophiliacs. ITP developed a mean 3.5 years after seroconversion, mean platelet count at presentation was 36,000/microL (range 15,000 to 49,000/microL), and the mean age at seroconversion was 37.1 years. Nine patients (82%) suffered bleeding complications, including four with intracranial hemorrhage, which was fatal in three. At the onset of ITP, five had AIDS and six were asymptomatic. Mean T4 lymphocyte count at onset of ITP was 126 +/- 32/microL (range 5 to 267/microL). Sustained treatment responses occurred with intravenous gammaglobulin (2 of 2), one of whom spontaneously remitted, and with zidovudine (1 of 2), but not with steroids (0 of 6) or danazol (0 of 3). In conclusion, 13% of a cohort of HIV + hemophiliacs has developed ITP with platelets less than 50,000/microL, a significant proportion of whom (82%) have experienced bleeding complications. It is recommended that treatment for ITP in HIV + hemophiliacs be instituted once the platelet count falls below 50,000/microL in order to avoid serious hemorrhagic sequelae."
1899347,GeneReviews,"Untreated complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) deficiency is characterized by mild-to-moderate bleeding, although in some instances bleeding can be life-threatening. Most commonly, delayed bleeding is associated with injury, trauma, or surgery; spontaneous bleeding does not occur. While males and females with complete PAI-1 deficiency are affected equally, females may present more frequently with clinical manifestations or earlier in life than males due to menorrhagia and postpartum hemorrhage. Fewer than ten families with complete PAI-1 deficiency have been reported to date.

36872469,Free Flap Reconstruction of Recalcitrant Defects in Cleft Palate Patients.,"Defects of the palate can be as a result of oronasal fistula of cleft patients and the ablative surgery of tumors. There are many studies about reconstruction of the defects of plate in the literature and most of them are related to tumor surgery. Despite the use of free flaps in cleft patients being not a new approach, the articles in the literature are very few. The authors describe the experience of oronasal fistula reconstructions with free flaps with a new modification of tensionless inset of the free flap's pedicle.
Between 2019 and 2022, 2 males and 1 female, 3 consecutive cleft patients underwent free flap surgery because of recalcitrant palatal defects. One patient had 5 and each of remain had 3 unsuccessful reconstructive attempts previously. The age of patients was ranged from 20 to 23 years old. Radial forearm flap was the option of oral lining reconstruction for all patients. In 2 patients, the flap was modified as a skin tail was linked to the flap for covering the pedicle as tensionless closure.
There was a mucosal swelling in first patient who underwent classical pedicle inset as mucosal tunneling. In 1 patient there was a spontaneous bleeding from the anterior side of the flap and it stopped without medical interventions, spontaneously. There was no additional complication. All flaps survived without anastomosis problems.
Incision of the mucosa rather than tunneling provides good surgical exposure and bleeding control and modified flap design may be beneficial and reliable for tensionless pedicle inset and covering."
36863910,Spontaneous Hyphema and Vitreous Hemorrhage Causing Secondary Glaucoma in a Patient on Apixaban.,"Spontaneous hyphema is the rare occurrence of hemorrhage within the anterior chamber of the eye without a predisposing traumatic event. Hyphema can be associated with acute elevations in intraocular pressure in up to 30% of cases, which poses a significant risk for permanent vision loss if not quickly recognized and treated in the emergency department (ED). Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications have been previously associated with cases of spontaneous hyphema; however, there are limited reports of hyphema with associated acute glaucoma in a patient taking a direct oral anticoagulant. Due to the limited data of reversal therapies for direct oral anticoagulants in intraocular hemorrhage, these patients pose a challenge in deciding whether to reverse anticoagulation in the ED.
We present a case of a 79-year-old man on apixaban anticoagulation therapy who presented to the ED with spontaneous painful vision loss in the right eye with associated hyphema. Point-of-care ultrasound revealed an associated vitreous hemorrhage, and tonometry was significant for acute glaucoma. As a result, the decision was made to reverse the patient's anticoagulation with four-factor activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? This case is an example of acute secondary glaucoma due to a hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage. There is limited evidence regarding anticoagulation reversal in this setting. A second site of bleeding was identified by utilization of point-of-care ultrasound, which led to the diagnosis of a vitreous hemorrhage. This allowed for shared decision-making between the emergency physician, ophthalmologist, and patient regarding the risks and potential benefits of the reversal of anticoagulation. Ultimately, the patient decided to have his anticoagulation reversed to try and preserve vision."
36813377,Clinical Evaluation of Factor XIa Inhibitor Drugs: JACC Review Topic of the Week.,"Factor XI/XIa (FXI/FXIa) represents a potential target for improved precision in anticoagulation because it is involved primarily in thrombus formation and plays a much smaller role in clotting and hemostasis. This suggests that the inhibition of FXI/XIa could prevent pathologic thrombi from forming, but largely preserve a patient's ability to clot in response to bleeding or trauma. This theory is supported by observational data showing that patients with congenital FXI deficiency have lower rates of embolic events without an increase in spontaneous bleeding. Small phase 2 trials of FXI/XIa inhibitors have offered encouraging data with regard to bleeding and safety and evidence of efficacy for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. However, larger clinical trials across multiple patient groups are needed for this emerging class of anticoagulants to understand their possible role in clinical use. Here we review the potential clinical indications for FXI/XIa inhibitors, data available to date, and consider future trials."
36726162,"The ""SALPARE study"" of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: part 1.","Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating type of stroke with a huge impact on patients and families. Expanded use of oral anticoagulants and ageing population might contribute to an epidemiological change. In view of these trends, we planned a study to obtain a contemporary picture and identify early prognostic factors to improve secondary prevention.
This multicenter prospective cohort study included consecutive adult patients with non-traumatic ICH admitted to three academic Italian hospitals (Salerno, Padova, Reggio Emilia) over a 2-year period. Demographic characteristics, vascular risk profile, clinical data and main radiological characteristics were correlated to 90-day clinical outcome.
Out of 682 patients [mean age: 73 ± 14 years; 316 (46.3%) females] enrolled in this study, 40% died [86/180 (47.8%) in Salerno, 120/320 (37.5%) in Padova, 67/182 (36.8%) in Reggio Emilia; p < 0.05)] and 36% were severely disabled at 90 days. Several factors were associated with a higher risk of poor functional outcome such as antithrombotic drug use, hyperglycemia, previous cerebrovascular accident, low platelet count, and pontine/massive/intraventricular hemorrhage. However, at multivariate analysis only pre-ICH mRS score (OR 30.84), GCS score at presentation (OR 11.88), initial hematoma volume (OR 29.71), and NIHSS score at presentation (OR 25.89) were independent predictors of death and poor functional outcome.
Despite the heterogeneity among centers, this study on ICH has identified four simple prognostic factors that can independently predict patients outcome, stratify their risk, and guide their management."

It can result from trauma, infections, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. Here, we present a 58-year-old Caucasian man with fatigue, altered sensorium, bradycardia, and hypotension. He denied any abdominal pain, recent trauma, or anti-platelet or anti-coagulation agents. His laboratory workup showed hyponatremia with low serum cortisol levels. He was further worked up and underwent computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which showed bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. He was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids followed by oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. His symptoms resolved, and he was safely discharged home. Asymptomatic bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is a sporadic disease, and it should be in the differential diagnosis for disproportionately sick people with other adrenal insufficiency features."

During 9 years of follow-up, there were exacerbation episodes with spontaneous gum bleeding, ulcers in the interdental papilla, tooth mobility, and progressive tooth loss. Some of these exacerbation episodes resolved clinically with the administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole. We therefore proposed an oral microbiome study (subgingival and saliva samples) before and after antibiotic therapy. The most abundant genera at the subgingival level before administering antibiotics were "
36523382,Spontaneous sublingual hematoma secondary to warfarin therapy-A rare complication.,"Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant in Nepal. It is commonly used for chronic anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and artificial heart valves. The major side effect of warfarin is bleeding. Though extremely rare, a sublingual hematoma can lead to life-threatening complications as it can cause severe airway obstruction. We present a case of a 55-year-old female patient who had sublingual hematoma secondary to the use of Warfarin therapy. In addition to the discontinuation of warfarin, she was managed conservatively without any surgical intervention. Early diagnosis, timely discontinuation of the drug, and application of appropriate medical treatment are of utmost importance for reducing morbidity and mortality due to bleeding and airway compromise."
36431188,A New Pharmacological Vitreolysis through the Supplement of Mixed Fruit Enzymes for Patients with Ocular Floaters or Vitreous Hemorrhage-Induced Floaters.,"Ocular floaters caused by vitreous degeneration or blood clots may interfere with various visual functions. Our study investigated the pharmacologic effects of oral supplementation of mixed fruit enzymes (MFEs) for treating spontaneous symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVOs) and those secondary to vitreous hemorrhage (VH).
224 patients with monocular symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVOs) were recruited between September and December 2017 and received oral supplementation of MFEs (190 mg bromelain, 95 mg papain, and 95 mg ficin) for 3 months in a double-blind clinical trial. Participants were divided according to the etiology of the SVOs, spontaneous (experiment 1) versus VH (experiment 2), and then randomly assigned into four treatments groups: one group received oral vitamin C, as a placebo; and the other 3 groups received 1 capsule per day (low dose), 2 capsules per day (middle dose), or 3 capsules per day (high dose) of MFEs. The number of SVOs was determined at baseline and then 1, 2, and 3 months after initiating treatment. Further, in cases secondary to VH, the changes in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were assessed after 3 months. Second, we compared the free radical scavenging capabilities of each substance: vitamin C, bromelain, papain, ficin, and MFEs (combination of bromelain, papain, and ficin) by DDPH assay. Finally, SVOs-related symptoms and satisfaction with the treatments were evaluated at the last follow-up visit Results: In experiment 1, the disappearance rate of SVOs was 55%, 62.5%, and 70% after taking 1, 2, and 3 capsules daily, respectively (total 
A pharmacological approach using a high dose of oral supplementation with MFEs (bromelain, papain, and ficin) was effective in reducing vitreous opacities, even after intraocular hemorrhage. Furthermore, pharmacologic vitreolysis with MFEs supplementation showed high patient satisfaction, and also improved CDVA in patients with vitreous hemorrhage-induced floaters."
36387731,Recurrent oral granuloma gravidarum during two pregnancies of a patient with orthodontic treatment: A case report.,"The aim of this article was to present the medical management and follow-up of a recurrent oral granuloma gravidarum (OGG). OGG is a common benign tumour that can occur during pregnancy in response to poor oral hygiene and hormonal factors. Its identification and management by primary health care professionals is necessary, including an orientation to a dentist, if needed. Indeed, this lesion may induce troubles such as gingival bleeding, oral hygiene difficulties, and sometimes pain or eating difficulties, but also presents a high risk of relapse. An early twenties woman consulted several times during two pregnancies for an OGG presented in the same proximal maxillary gingival area. The patient reported dental hygiene difficulties because of orthodontic treatment and developed this recurrent tumour four times in two years, despite surgical excisions. Oral hygiene, and information continuously provided by healthcare professionals are required to prevent gingival inflammation and recurrence of OGG. This tumour usually regresses spontaneously post-partum, except in the presence of aggravating factors such as orthodontics treatment and mouth breathing. Surgery of OGG is required when it interferes with normal oral functions."
36381894,Hemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion From Apixaban Use: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have revolutionized therapy for stroke prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. These medications are generally well tolerated and are not associated with the inconvenience of repeat international normalized ratio (INR) checks. While bleeding in general is a common side effect associated with DOACs, especially from a gastrointestinal source, spontaneous hemorrhagic pericardial effusions are not seen frequently. Herein, we present a case of a patient who developed a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion three days after the initiation of apixaban. We also summarize the current data that is available showing this side effect and highlight an important risk factor that may predispose patients to this complication."
36261222,Spontaneous intraperitoneal haemorrhage of the gastric vessels.,"A male in his 70s presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset abdominal pain and syncope. While in the emergency department, he developed worsening hypotension and anaemia. A CT angiogram was suggestive of abdominal apoplexy (spontaneous intraperitoneal haemorrhage), which was treated successfully with embolisation of the bleeding vessels. Spontaneous bleeding was thought to be related to his initiation of apixaban 1 week previously. The patient made an excellent recovery and was transitioned back to oral anticoagulation."
36192770,Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma associated with apixaban in an elderly gentleman with chronic obstructive airway disease - a case report.,"Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is a relatively uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain and can be mistaken as other surgical causes of acute abdomen. A diagnosis requires high index of suspicion especially in susceptible patients, for example, in patients on anticoagulation. While anticoagulation is the commonest risk factor for RSH, direct-acting oral anticoagulants have only been very recently implicated as a potential cause with fewer than ten cases reported in the literature.
An 82-year-old Chinese man with chronic obstructive airway disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation on apixaban presenting with acute onset of lower abdominal pain. Physical examination showed peritoneal signs with tenderness and guarding over the lower quadrants with hypotension. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen confirmed a large rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) without active extravasation. He was given fluid resuscitation and was managed successfully with supportive treatment and cessation of apixaban. A follow-up CT two months later showed resolving hematoma and aspirin was resumed primarily for ischemic heart disease. The patient tolerated anti-platelet therapy without recurrence of RSH. The risk factors, treatment options, prognosis and issue related to anticoagulation resumption after an episode of RSH are discussed. Reported cases of RSH associated with direct-acting oral anticoagulants are reviewed.
Direct-acting oral anticoagulant-associated rectus sheath hematoma is rare. With increasing use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants in multiple clinical settings, clinicians should remain vigilant of this potentially life-threatening bleeding complication when a patient presents with acute abdominal pain. Conservative treatment with cessation of anti-coagulant and supportive transfusion remains the mainstay of treatment."
36066724,Warfarin Overdose in an Adolescent Not Dependent on Anticoagulation: Reversal Strategy and Kinetics.,"Warfarin induces coagulopathy. Guidelines protocolize reversal of supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) in patients dependent on anticoagulation, but practices vary for reversing warfarin-induced coagulopathy after overdose in non-warfarin-dependent patients.
This is the report of a 15-year-old female who ingested her father's warfarin (100-200 mg) in a self-harm attempt. At hour 24 post-ingestion, her INR was 2.00 and she was admitted for monitoring. Reversal of coagulopathy was initially deferred pending the INR trend. The INR was 5.10 at hour 60 and 2.5 mg oral vitamin K
A restrictive approach to coagulopathy reversal in non-warfarin-dependent patients with intentional warfarin overdose may result in worsening coagulopathy, bleeding, and lengthy hospital stay. Given the risk for significant, prolonged coagulopathy, these patients should be treated early with VK1, with subsequent serial INR monitoring and probable additional VK1 dosing. Delayed peak warfarin concentrations support consideration of gastrointestinal decontamination in late presenters."
35959311,Plasma cell gingivitis: A perplexing and rare clinical entity.,"Plasma cell gingivitis (PCG) is a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. It is also referred to as atypical gingivostomatitis, idiopathic gingivostomatitis, allergic gingivostomatitis, and plasma cell gingivostomatitis which are characterized by bright fiery red gingiva with spontaneous bleeding on slight provocation. It is often confused with inflammatory gingival enlargement, erythematosus lichen planus, and other lesions. One such rare and benign entity is discussed in this article and managed after thorough clinical, radiological, histopathology, immunohistochemistry analysis."
35862238,Effectiveness and Safety of Antithrombotic Medication in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Intracranial Hemorrhage: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"For patients with atrial fibrillation who survive an intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH), the decision to offer oral anticoagulation (OAC) is challenging and necessitates balancing risk of thromboembolic events with risk of recurrent ICrH.
This systematic review assesses the effectiveness and safety of OAC and/or antiplatelets in patients with atrial fibrillation with nontraumatic ICrH. Bibliographic databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched. Articles on adults with atrial fibrillation with spontaneous ICrH (intracerebral, subdural, and subarachnoid), receiving antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention were eligible for inclusion.
Twenty articles (50 470 participants) included 2 randomized controlled trials (n=304)' 8 observational studies, 8 cohort studies, and 2 studies that meta-analyzed individual-level data from observational studies. OAC therapy was associated with a significant reduction in thromboembolic events (summary relative risk [sRR], 0.51 [95% CI, 0.30-0.86], heterogeneity I
In nontraumatic ICrH survivors with atrial fibrillation, OAC therapy is associated with a reduced risk of thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality without significantly increasing risk of recurrent ICrH. This finding is primarily based on observational data, and further larger randomized controlled trials are needed to corroborate or refute these findings."
35718657,Spontaneous epiglottic hematoma secondary to direct oral anticoagulant.,"Spontaneous hemorrhage is a known risk for patients on anticoagulation therapy. Most previous spontaneous airway hemorrhage cases reported involve warfarin, and of the few that involved a direct oral anticoagulant, none involved the epiglottis. The following case describes a spontaneous epiglottic hematoma in a patient one week after starting a direct oral anticoagulant. An 85-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute onset of neck swelling, odynophagia and sublingual ecchymosis. Evaluation in the emergency department included advanced imaging of the neck and consultation with otolaryngology. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed a markedly enlarged and ecchymotic epiglottis. The patient received medical management including rivaroxaban reversal, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no airway management was deemed necessary. After close monitoring, the patient was discharged on hospital day two. Further research and risk profiling could benefit patients and emergency clinicians when considering spontaneous hemorrhage in the airway in patients taking a direct oral anticoagulant."
35645722,Pilot Study of Remote Ischemic Conditioning in Acute Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,Spontaneous Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating injury that accounts for 10-15% of all strokes. The rupture of cerebral blood vessels damaged by hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy creates a space-occupying hematoma that contributes toward neurological deterioration and high patient morbidity and mortality. Numerous protocols have explored a role for surgical decompression of ICH 
35623935,Evolving concepts in the management of antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"Thromboembolic and bleeding complications negatively impact recovery and survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Particularly, there is a considerable risk of ischaemic stroke and vascular access related bleeding, as well as spontaneous gastro-intestinal bleeding. Therefore, benefit and harm of antithrombotic therapy should be carefully balanced. This review summarizes current evidence on peri- and post-procedural antithrombotic treatment. Indeed, in recent years, the management of antithrombotic therapy after TAVI has evolved from intensive, expert opinion-based strategies, towards a deescalated, evidence-based approach. Besides per procedural administration of unfractionated heparin, this encompasses single antiplatelet therapy in patients without a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC); and OAC monotherapy in patients with such indication, mainly being atrial fibrillation. Combination therapy should generally be avoided to reduce bleeding risk, except after recent coronary stenting where a period of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus P2Y12-inhibitor) or P2Y12-inhibitor plus OAC (in patients with an independent indication for OAC) is recommended to prevent stent thrombosis. This new paradigm in which reduced antithrombotic intensity leads to improved patient safety, without a loss of efficacy, may be particularly suitable for elderly and fragile patients. Whether this holds in upcoming populations of younger and lower-risk patients and in specific populations as patients with subclinical valve thrombosis, is yet to be proven. Finally, whether less intensive or alternative approaches should be also applied for the periprocedural management of the antithrombotic therapy, has to be determined by ongoing and future studies."
35537230,A retrospective review of spontaneous epistaxis outcomes for patients on novel oral anticoagulants compared to antiplatelets and warfarin.,"The incidence of epistaxis-related admissions amongst elderly patients is rising due to the increasing use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. This retrospective study evaluates the differences in outcomes for patients on warfarin, novel anticoagulants (NOACs) and antiplatelets over two different time periods.
Retrospective case-control study with data from patients admitted with epistaxis through the Flinders Medical Centre Emergency Department in the first six months of 2013 and compared to the same period in 2018. The latter coincides with integration of NOACs into Australian prescribing practices. Included participants were ≥50 years with spontaneous epistaxis which coincides with peak incidence in adults. Exclusion criteria were epistaxis due to trauma, intrinsic coagulopathy, or recent post-surgery. Linear regression and binary logistic regression models were the statistical methods used.
Data from 85 patients were analysed for length of stay (LOS), readmission rates and method of haemostasis. In 2013, 41 patients were included compared to 44 in 2018, suggesting a 7% increase in admissions rates but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.96). The proportion of patients admitted with epistaxis while taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent increased from 66% in 2013 to 93% in 2018. Thirty six percent of patients in 2018 were taking NOACs, however, LOS was 2 times shorter (mean ratio = 2.08 days, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.19). Seven percent of patients in 2018 had bleeding requiring surgery or interventional radiology, compared to 12% in 2013, but this was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference in readmission rates (p = 0.82) or intervention required (p = 0.74) between the two time periods.
Epistaxis admissions at our institution have increased since the introduction of NOACs. However, most patients can be managed successfully with intranasal packing and cautery alone. NOACs are not associated with increased rated of invasive haemostatic measures and patients have a shorter LOS."
35533994,Outcome of Budd-Chiari Syndrome Patients Treated With Direct Oral Anticoagulants: An Austrian Multicenter Study.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may simplify management of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Here, we report our experience with off-label use of DOACs for anticoagulation in BCS.
The safety of DOAC vs vitamin K antagonist treatment as well as associated clinical outcomes were retrospectively assessed in 47 BCS patients treated at 6 Austrian centers.
Mean age at study inclusion was 37.9 ± 14.0 years and mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease was 13.1 ± 5.1. Overall, 63.8% (n = 30) of patients had decompensated liver disease, and 87.2% (n = 41) showed clinical signs of portal hypertension. During a median follow-up of 82.5 (interquartile range, 43.1-121.8) months, 43 (91.5%) patients received anticoagulation alone or following interventional treatment, including 22 (46.8%) patients treated with DOACs (edoxaban: 10, apixaban: 4, rivaroxaban: 3, dabigatran: 3, more than one DOAC sequentially: 2) for a median of 24.4 (interquartile range, 5.7-35.1) months. While 72.7% (n = 16 of 22) of patients were switched from low-molecular-weight heparin (n = 12) or vitamin K antagonist (n = 4) to DOAC after disease stabilization or improvement, 27.3% (n = 6 of 22) of BCS patients were initially treated with DOAC. Complete response (European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria) was achieved or maintained in 14 (63.6%) of 22 patients, with ongoing response in 2 patients, while disease progressed in 6 patients (including 2 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma). Four major spontaneous bleedings (18.2%; incidence rate 8.8 per 100 patient-years; n = 2 upper gastrointestinal bleeding, n = 1 lower gastrointestinal bleeding, n = 1 hepatocellular carcinoma rupture), 7 minor bleedings, and 1 major procedure-related bleeding (4.5%; 2.2 per 100 patient-years) occurred during DOAC therapy. Overall transplant-free survival was 91.6% at 5 years.
DOACs seem to be effective and safe for long-term anticoagulation in patients with BCS, but confirmation by larger prospective studies is needed."
35429425,Rezūm water vapor therapy for catheter-dependent urinary retention: a real-world Canadian experience.,"This analysis reported outcomes of treating catheter-dependent urinary retention with Rezūm water vapor therapy.
A prospective registry was established at two high-volume Canadian centers. Patients had baseline medical and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) history documented. The subgroup of patients with refractory, catheter-dependent urinary retention was analyzed. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were spontaneously voiding and catheter-free at 6 months.
Sixteen patients (age: 68.7 years) with catheter-dependent urinary retention were treated with Rezūm. Average prostate volume was 84.4 mL and 75% had median lobe. All patients had at least one recent failed trial without catheter (TWOC) and 87.5% were on BPH oral therapy. Mean number of vapor injections was 14.5. Visibility and bleeding during procedure were assessed using a 5-point scale, and were rated as 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. Anesthesia was either intravenous propofol sedation (n = 13) or self-administered methoxyflurane inhaler (n = 3). Mean catheter duration until first planned TWOC was 28.4 days. Three patients needed catheter replacement due to initial failed TWOC. One patient was lost to follow up, one patient did not return at 1 month, and one patient did not return at 3 months. At 1 month, 13/14 patients were spontaneously voiding and catheter-free. At 3 months, 14/14 patients were spontaneously voiding, and at 6 months, 15/15 patients were spontaneously voiding and catheter-free (1 patient was lost to follow up).
Rezūm water vapor therapy can successfully treat catheter-dependent urinary retention after initial failed TWOC in an outpatient setting."
35282102,Resumption of anticoagulation therapy after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with patients mechanical heart valves.,"Patients with mechanical heart valves are usually maintained on anticoagulation therapy. However, after a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage event, administration of anticoagulants is temporarily ceased, and it remains unclear when to restart anticoagulation therapy.
A cohort study was conducted to investigate the optimal time for restarting anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valves after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. All patients with mechanical valves who experienced spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage and were admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Zhejiang University Medical School between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The patient electronic medical records were reviewed and the correlation between the time of restarting anticoagulation (within 3 days or more than 3 days after hemorrhage) and patient prognosis was assessed.
A total of 40 patients with mechanical heart valves who experienced spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage were enrolled in this study. All patients were given oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy prior to admission (1.5-3.25 mg). After admission, patients were administered fresh frozen plasma and/or vitamin K1 to reverse anticoagulation. Out of the 16 patients (40%) who underwent surgical intervention, 4 died from cerebral hemorrhage deterioration during the hospital stay and did not restart anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulant therapy was resumed within 3 days for 18 patients and more than three days after hemorrhage for the other 18 patients. After discharge, patients were followed up for 12 months or more. Unfortunately, during this period, 17% of patients (6/36) died.
Definitive hemostatic measures can be as an important factor in the clinical resumption of anticoagulation. Halting anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 7 days may be safe. It is recommended that low molecular heparin be administered within 3 days as a bridge treatment, combine with warfarin anticoagulant therapy within 1 week after hemorrhage."
35223012,Unusual case of spontaneous bilateral basal ganglia bleed.,"Hypertension is the most prevalent determinant condition embarking on the development of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Usually, the presentation is a unilateral hematoma. Spontaneous bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage is an outstandingly infrequent context, and not a lot of cases have been reported till date. Ensuing hypertension, trauma inflicted on the brain case is another common cause that out turn into the sequelae of bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage. Lately, a few cases of bilateral basal ganglia bleed have been revealed, as a repercussion of COVID-19 infection. Globally, <40 such cases have been reported. A 39-year-old man presented with complaints of acute onset of weakness of right half of the body. Additionally, facial deviation was noticed by his family members. He then sought medical help from a local healthcare center where CT scan of head was advised. Unexpectedly, the scan demonstrated bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage. He was then managed conservatively with oral medications and rehabilitation. The course of his hospital stay was uneventful and was eventually discharged after 9 days. He then presented to our institution for further evaluation. Thereupon, he had slurring of speech but was able to walk with minimal support. Simultaneous Bilateral Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage (SBBGH) is an exceptionally rare ailment. This genre of cerebrovascular accident embraces a comprehensive span of morbidity and mortality. In an acute setting, CT scan of head is the most relevant imaging modality. Nonetheless, MRI is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and should be performed urgently to further typify and delineate the lesion."
35211610,Bulbar conjunctival vascular lesion combined with spontaneous retrobulbar hematoma: A case report.,"Orbital hemorrhage can be classified as traumatic or spontaneous depending on its cause. Spontaneous orbital hemorrhage refers to an internal orbital hemorrhage without apparent cause. Therefore, we aimed to describe a case of an orbital hematoma after a severe cough the night before due to inhalation of cooking oil fumes.
A 46-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a complaint of exophthalmos accompanied with blurred vision, pain, binocular diplopia, and dizziness lasting for 5 h noted on waking in the morning. She also experienced nausea and vomiting due to high pressure of orbit and dizziness. Based on the auxiliary examination and her medical history, the patient was finally diagnosed with bulbar conjunctival vascular lesion combined with spontaneous retrobulbar hematoma. The patient was administered tobramycin and dexamethasone eye ointment, and applied pressure dressing on the left eye to stop the bleeding. Simultaneously, we administered intravenous etamsylate, oral Yunnan Baiyao capsule, intravenous mannitol to reduce orbital pressure, and intravenous dexamethasone injection at 10 mg/dL combined with neurotrophic therapy to reduce tissue edema. Among them, the Yunnan Baiyao capsule is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine to remove stasis and stop bleeding; thus, it promotes blood circulation and relieves pain resulting in reduced edema of the lesion site. The symptoms did not improve significantly during the first 2 d of treatment. We speculate that high orbital pressure and binocular diplopia induced frequent nausea and vomiting in the patient, causing increased pressure on the superior vena cava and leading to repeated orbital bleeding. After the second day, the symptoms started gradually improving.
This case further emphasizes the importance of comprehensive, detailed medical history and careful ophthalmic examination of the patient."
35111488,An Unusual Case of Acute Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,"Acute atraumatic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) that results from a hematoma as a complication of oral anticoagulation use is a highly uncommon presentation. CTS is a common type of peripheral compression neuropathy, with CTS's acute presentation being less common than chronic. The acute type is commonly caused either by recent trauma, including fractures of the distal radius and carpal dislocations, atraumatic etiologies like infections, or inflammatory conditions that increase the pressure in the carpal tunnel. Timely diagnosis of acute CTS is essential, as often surgical decompression is required if symptoms do not improve within hours. A 79-year-old female presented to the ED with a past medical history significant for stroke, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, and hypertension. She complained of a one-day history of left wrist pain, swelling, and restricted range of motion, associated with numbness in the median nerve distribution and weakening of the handgrip. The patient denied any trauma or unusual physical activity. CCT imaging of the left upper extremity showed soft tissue expansion around the flexor pollicis longus proximal to and just distal to the carpal tunnel consistent with dissecting hematoma within the flexor compartment. The orthopedics hand team evaluated the patient. Her rivaroxaban was held, and she was monitored for 24 hours in the hospital. The next day, she almost had a complete resolution of her symptoms. She was discharged home with a close follow-up. There are various atraumatic causes of acute CTS. Spontaneous atraumatic hematoma occurring in the forearm's flexor compartment and resulting in acute CTS is extremely uncommon. In contrast to chronic CTS, acute CTS requires urgent carpal tunnel release to prevent irreversible median nerve damage. Anticoagulants in such cases increase the bleeding risk. This case highlights the importance of considering CTS into the differential diagnosis of someone on an anticoagulant and presenting with acute wrist swelling and pain. Despite the absence of any direct trauma, timely diagnosis of this condition is prudent and greatly affects the outcomes."
34937568,An unusual case of bone regeneration of a necrotic mandible with pathologic fracture in an elderly hemodialysis patient with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: a case report and review of the literature.,"Bisphosphonates are frequently used for osteoporosis. Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, a complication of bone-modifying agents, including bisphosphonates or angiogenic inhibitors, can be challenging to treat in elderly patients with numerous preexisting conditions. Achieving good treatment outcomes is especially difficult in patients with pathological fractures accompanied with extraoral fistulae.
We report an unusual case of prominent bone regeneration following palliative surgical treatment in a 72-year-old Japanese female patient undergoing hemodialysis. She previously had severe osteoporosis due to renal osteodystrophy and was receiving antiresorptive intravenous bisphosphonate. Computed tomography revealed a discontinuous left lower mandibular margin with a pathologic fracture and extensive, morphologically irregular sequestrum formation (80 × 35 × 20 mm). The patient was diagnosed with stage III medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and pathologic mandibular fracture. Immediately before the surgery, the anticoagulant used for dialysis was changed from heparin to nafamostat mesylate to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Sequestrectomy was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative infection was not observed, the intraoral and submandibular fistula disappeared, and, surprisingly, prominent spontaneous bone regeneration was observed postoperatively at 6 months. Despite the severe systemic condition of the patient, the conservative surgical approach with sequestrectomy has yielded desirable results for more than 6 years since the surgery.
This rare report of spontaneous bone regeneration in a patient of advanced age and poor general condition is the oldest case of mandibular regeneration ever reported."
34899259,The Effectiveness of Propranolol in Managing Hemorrhagic Choroidal and Exudative Retinal Detachment following Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Implantation in Sturge-Weber Syndrome: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a congenital neurological disorder that is characterized by hamartomas involving the skin, brain, and eyes and marked by the presence of the facial port-wine stain, which consequently leads to various ocular complications. Among all ocular comorbidities, glaucoma is the most frequently witnessed in SWS patients with a prevalence of 30%-70%. If glaucoma is refractory to conventional medical management, surgical intervention can be considered. Common complications of glaucoma procedures in SWS are choroidal detachment and suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Moreover, we report a 6-year-old girl, known case of unilateral congenital glaucoma secondary to SWS. Despite being on maximal antiglaucoma drops and undergoing multiple surgical interventions, the patient had uncontrolled intraocular pressure of her right eye. A decision to proceed with Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation (AGVI) to the right eye was made. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient developed hemorrhagic choroidal detachment and exudative retinal detachment. A trial of oral propranolol (1.5-2 mg/kg/day) was then initiated for 4 months. After 30 days from oral propranolol course initiation, we started noticing a significant improvement of the hemorrhagic choroidal and exudative retinal detachment. Spontaneously, a marked reduction in subretinal fluid and suprachoroidal hemorrhage was also seen. Thus, the improvement was correlated with the propranolol therapy. Here, we report a significant improvement of the postoperative complications of AGVI in a patient with SWS, following 4 months of oral propranolol course (1.5-2 mg/kg/day). Further studies are needed to determine the dosage, duration, and optimal mechanism by which propranolol works in this situation."
34844198,The role of monitoring platelet function perioperatively and platelet transfusion for operated spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients with long-term oral antiplatelet therapy: A case report.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) with long-term oral antiplatelet therapy (LOAPT) is known as a dilemma in balancing the risk of postoperative rebleeding and ischemic events because of confused coagulation function. We herein describe a report of perioperative management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patient on long-term oral antiplatelet therapy.
A 42-year-old male patient on long-term oral antiplatelet therapy presented with coma, and he was diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Considering the patient's clinical condition, despite the thromboelastography suggested that the inhibition of platelet function was high preoperatively, an emergency craniectomy were underwent. After platelet transfusion during surgery and taking control of the clotting and platelet function postoperatively, the patient was stable without rebleeding and new ischemic events in perioperative period and recovered satisfactorily.
Rare studies have provided evidence for managing operated spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients on long-term oral antiplatelet therapy, and whether platelet transfusion is recommended was controversial. In this case, we presented monitoring and taking control of clotting and platelet function postoperatively would help in preventing rebleeding and ischemic events in such patients; moreover, platelet transfusion may quickly and safely reverse platelet dysfunction for emergency surgery. This case was the first to report platelet function and coagulation function management in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients with long-term oral antiplatelet therapy.
Monitoring and maintaining coagulation and platelet function perioperatively are essential to balance the risk of postoperative rebleeding and ischemic events."
34824518,Glanzmann Thrombasthenia: Use of the Soft Splint with Tranexamic Acid Paste to Reduce Spontaneous Oral Bleeding.,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare bleeding disorder due to defects in the glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa complex present on the platelet membrane. The most common mode of treatment for this disorder is platelet transfusion. However, scientific evidence does state that repeated transfusions could lead to auto immunization making transfusions ineffective.
To describe the use of a novel technique of soft splint with tranexamic acid paste to stop oral bleeding in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT).
A 7-year-old female patient with a known history of GT was referred to the pediatric department. The chief complaint of the patient revealed a history of spontaneous bleeding from the oral cavity. The patient required multiple teeth extractions due to severely carious teeth. History revealed that the patient was admitted to the hospital (casualty) three times within 1 month due to a similar complaint leading to hypovolemic shock. Several transfusion procedures were done to stop the spontaneous bleeding. To stop the intraoral bleeding without transfusions, a novel method of using a soft splint with tranexamic acid paste (500 mg tablet crushed and mixed with saline) in the area of spontaneous bleeding was employed with a successful follow-up of 7 months.
Soft splint with the tranexamic acid paste can serve as an effective method of treatment for patients with spontaneous oral bleeding due to medical conditions like GT.
This case report highlights the need for awareness among all the healthcare providers about the importance of regular dental visits. The healthcare providers also need to emphasize the same to all patients with medical conditions to avoid such life-threatening situations.

34821547,Mifepristone and misoprostol versus placebo and misoprostol for resolution of miscarriage in women diagnosed with missed miscarriage: the MifeMiso RCT.,"A randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study with health economic and nested qualitative studies to determine if mifepristone (Mifegyne
Women diagnosed with missed miscarriage in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy were randomly assigned (1 : 1 ratio) to receive 200 mg of oral mifepristone or matched placebo, followed by 800 μg of misoprostol 2 days later. A web-based randomisation system allocated the women to the two groups, with minimisation for age, body mass index, parity, gestational age, amount of bleeding and randomising centre. The primary outcome was failure to pass the gestational sac within 7 days after randomisation. The prespecified key secondary outcome was requirement for surgery to resolve the miscarriage. A within-trial cost-effectiveness study and a nested qualitative study were also conducted. Women who completed the trial protocol were purposively approached to take part in an interview to explore their satisfaction with and the acceptability of medical management of missed miscarriage.
A total of 711 women, from 28 hospitals in the UK, were randomised to receive either mifepristone plus misoprostol (357 women) or placebo plus misoprostol (354 women). The follow-up rate for the primary outcome was 98% (696 out of 711 women). The risk of failure to pass the gestational sac within 7 days was 17% (59 out of 348 women) in the mifepristone plus misoprostol group, compared with 24% (82 out of 348 women) in the placebo plus misoprostol group (risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.98; 
The results from this trial are not generalisable to women diagnosed with incomplete miscarriage and the study does not allow for a comparison with expectant or surgical management of miscarriage.
Future work should use existing data to assess and rank the relative clinical effectiveness and safety profiles for all methods of management of miscarriage.
Our trial showed that pre-treatment with mifepristone followed by misoprostol resulted in a higher rate of resolution of missed miscarriage than misoprostol treatment alone. Women were largely satisfied with medical management of missed miscarriage and would choose it again. The mifepristone and misoprostol intervention was shown to be cost-effective in comparison to misoprostol alone.

Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting approximately one in four women. Sometimes, medical treatment (i.e. tablets) may be offered to start or speed up the miscarriage process in order for the womb to empty itself. A drug called misoprostol (a tablet that makes the womb contract) is currently recommended for this treatment. However, the addition of another drug called mifepristone [a tablet that reduces pregnancy hormones (Mifegyne"
34797284,Endoscopic removal of accidental aspirated and ingested dental foreign bodies: A cross-sectional study.,"The incidence of accidental ingestion and aspiration of foreign body (FB) is likely to occur. Many FBs are discharged spontaneously, but many dental FBs are often sharp and may remain in the pharynx, esophagus, and stomach, causing serious complications such as hemorrhage, asphyxia, perforation of the digestive tract, mediastinal emphysema, peritonitis, and ileus. We aimed to examine which type of dental foreign bodies can be removed by endoscope.In this study, we enrolled 32 patients who were evaluated at the Emergency and Critical Center between January 2014 and December 2019 and who accidentally ingested or aspirated dental FBs. Medical records were reviewed to determine the patients' sex, age, medical history, time from accidental ingestion of a FB to consultation, cause, location, occurrence status, nature of the FB, location of retained FB, treatment, complications, and outcome.We enrolled 32 patients (14 men, 18 women), with a mean age of 74.5 ± 12.8 years. Accidental ingestion at treatment was common. The most frequent site where the FB was retained was upper gastrointestinal tract (26 cases, 81.3%). In this study, endoscopic removal was indicated for dentures under the size of 43.3 mm, for dental FB (except dentures) more than 13.6 mm. In dentures, between the number of missing teeth, clasp, type, and endoscopic removal was not statistically significant.Dentures under the size of 43.3 mm was likely to be removed by endoscope. Dental FB (except dentures) more than the size of 13.6 mm was likely to be removed by endoscope. There were no indications for endoscopic removal except for size."
34779569,Prothrombin complex concentrates for the urgent reversal of apixaban and rivaroxaban: an Australian retrospective cohort study.,"Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are now commonly prescribed medications. Urgent reversal of their anticoagulant effect is sometimes required in emergency situations. In Australia, a specific reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa)-inhibitor DOAC is not available. Instead, two non-specific haemostatic agents, activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and 3 factor-prothrombin complex concentrate (3F-PCC), are used off-label despite a paucity of evidence for their effectiveness or safety.
To provide further insight into the efficacy and safety of 3F-PCC and aPCC for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of FXa inhibitor DOACs.
We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study to investigate the use of aPCC and 3F-PCC for patients on FXa-inhibitor DOAC who present with a significant bleeding event or who require urgent surgery. The primary outcome was haemostatic efficacy according to prespecified criteria. Safety outcomes included the thromboembolic event rate and all-cause mortality during the hospital admission.
A total of 51 patients was included in the study (36 patients who had a spontaneous bleeding event and 15 non-bleeding patients who required urgent perioperative management). Thirty-one patients received aPCC and 20 patients received 3F-PCC. Haemostasis was adjudicated as effective in all assessable patients (n = 50; 100%). Thromboembolic events occurred in three patients who received aPCC and one patient who received 3F-PCC. All-cause mortality was 7.8% (four patients).
Both aPCC and 3F-PCC are useful adjuncts for the management of patients who require urgent reversal of the anticoagulant effect of FXa-inhibitor DOAC. However, the risk of thromboembolism in this patient group requires careful consideration. Prospective, comparator studies are needed along with the development of guidelines that reflect the availability of haemostatic agents in Australia."
34671000,Treatment of Severe Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Associated with COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is associated with many hematological manifestations, including lymphopenia and thrombosis. There have been rare occasions in which thrombocytopenia has been reported as the sole clinical presentation of COVID-19. CASE REPORT This is the case report of a 48-year-old Hispanic female patient with COVID-19 presenting as severe isolated thrombocytopenia. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with hemoptysis, spontaneous bruising, and excessive vaginal bleeding and also reported a recent flu-like illness. On examination, she was found to have bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, diffuse oral ulcers, epigastric abdominal tenderness, and ecchymosis on her chest, with scattered petechiae and palpable purpura on her lower limbs. Laboratory results were significant for a platelet count of 0×10⁹ and an immature platelet fraction of 34.1%. Owing to clinical suspicion, the patient was tested for COVID-19, and her test result was positive. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisone, rituximab, vitamin C, and zinc. Upon achieving hemodynamic stability, she was discharged to follow up with a hematologist in the outpatient setting. CONCLUSIONS Hematological consequences of COVID-19 are becoming more prevalent. The mechanism behind this manifestation could be bone marrow failure, formation of platelet autoantibodies, or consumptive coagulopathy. These critical manifestations are necessary to manage, especially in severe forms like in our patient. Steroids and rituximab combination therapy have proven to be the most effective regimen."
34586928,Spontaneous hemothorax caused by concomitant low-dose rivaroxaban and itraconazole in a 95-year-old patient: case report and literature review.,"Although direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) decrease the bleeding risk compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs might cause spontaneous hemothorax in very elderly patients, even at a very low dose. Interactions between drugs might increase the risk of bleeding. In this article, we report a case of a 95-year-old man who developed spontaneous hemothorax while taking rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily, 3 days after concomitant use of itraconazole. Rivaroxaban was discontinued, and thoracentesis was performed to drain grossly bloody pleural effusion. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of spontaneous hemothorax that might have been caused by concomitant low-dose rivaroxaban and azole anti-fungal agents. This case highlights the potential risk of spontaneous hemothorax in very elderly patients while taking rivaroxaban and azole anti-fungal agents simultaneously. Special attention should be paid to interactions between drugs that might increase the risk of bleeding. Drugs that have competing metabolic pathways should be avoided. Closer monitoring, including testing for anti-Xa and additional reassessment, should be considered in high-risk patients."
34580019,A Retrospective Study of Perioperative Nursing Care of Patients After Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion.,"To describe the retrospective audit examining nursing care of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation treated by percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (PLAAC).
PLAAC is a new technique for patients with atrial fibrillation unsuited for long-term oral anticoagulation treatment. The nursing care for patients treated by PLAAC has not yet been standardized.
We performed a retrospective analysis of 259 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who underwent PLAAC in our department between August 2014 and June 2018. The data included preoperative evaluations, discussions, and preparations, including psychological care and atrial thrombosis screening; postoperative observations, including electrocardiograph monitoring; prevention and care of complications; administration of postoperative anticoagulation therapy; and postoperative education, including detailed discharge guidance and regular follow-up.
All patients were discharged after 5-10 days of hospitalization. In the perioperative period, 4 cases (1.5%) developed serious complications, including 3 cases (1.2%) of delayed cardiac tamponade, cured by pericardial drainage, and 1 case of a suspected air embolism, which spontaneously recovered. During a mean follow-up period of 25.9 ± 7.9 months, all patients had good adherence to medical instructions and there were no cases of occluder displacement or shedding, thromboembolism, or severe bleeding complications.
The best therapeutic effect of PLAAC is strongly associated with the preoperative and postoperative training of nursing staff and the development of standard nursing procedures, including the establishment of observation and nursing manuals for complications. This study provides nursing practice information to aid in the standardization of nursing procedures for this new type of interventional therapy."
34532772,Efficacy of Naoxueshu in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a multicenter observational study.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety outcome and related risk factors of Naoxueshu in the treatment of acute SICH.
Two hundred twenty patients were enrolled in this study. Diagnosis of SICH was based on neuroimaging. All the patients received regular treatment and Naoxueshu oral liquid 10 ml 3 times a day for 14 consecutive days. Surgical intervention was conducted as needed. Efficacy and safety outcomes were evaluated.
Hematoma volume decreased significantly 7 days after Naoxueshu treatment (from 27.3 ± 20.0 to 15.1 ± 15.1 ml, P < 0.0001), and it decreased further in 14-day result (6.9 ± 10.4 ml, P < 0.0001). Patients' neurological function was improved remarkably with NIHSS scores from baseline 13 points to 7-day 7 points (P < 0.0001) and 14-day 4 points (P < 0.0001). Cerebral edema was relieved only 14 days after Naoxueshu treatment (from 3 to 2 points, P < 0.0001). No clinically significant change was found in 7-day and 14-day safety results. Female sex was related independently to large 7-day hematoma volume and worse 7-day NIHSS score while it would not affect patients' 14-day outcomes. Rare cause of SICH (B = 17.4, P = 0.009) alone was related to large 14-day hematoma volume. Worse baseline NIHSS score (B = 0.3, P = 0.003) and early use of Naoxueshu (B = 2.9, P = 0.005) were related to worse 7-day and14-day neurological function.
Naoxueshu oral liquid could relieve hematoma volume and cerebral edema safely; meanwhile, it could improve patients' neurological function. Sex, cause of SICH, and time from onset to receive Naoxueshu should be taken into consideration in the treatment of SICH."
34531298,Spontaneous ARIA-like Events in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Related Inflammation: A Multicenter Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.,"The goal of this work was to investigate the natural history and outcomes after treatment for spontaneous amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)-like in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri).
This was a multicenter, hospital-based, longitudinal, prospective observational study of inpatients meeting CAA-ri diagnostic criteria recruited through the Inflammatory Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Alzheimer's Disease βiomarkers International Network from January 2013 to March 2017. A protocol for systematic data collection at first-ever presentation and at subsequent in-person visits, including T1-weighted, gradient recalled echo-T2*, fluid-suppressed T2-weighted (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), and T1 postgadolinium contrast-enhanced images acquired on 1.5T MRI, was used at the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. Centralized reads of MRIs were performed by investigators blinded to clinical, therapeutic, and time-point information. Main outcomes were survival, clinical and radiologic recovery, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and recurrence of CAA-ri.
The study enrolled 113 participants (10.6% definite, 71.7% probable, and 17.7% possible CAA-ri). Their mean age was 72.9 years; 43.4% were female; 37.1% were 
These results from the largest longitudinal cohort registry of patients with CAA-ri support the transient and potentially relapsing inflammatory nature of the clinical-radiologic acute manifestations of the disease and the effectiveness of slow oral tapering off after IV corticosteroid pulse therapy in preventing recurrences. Our results highlight the importance of differential diagnosis for spontaneous ARIA-like events in β-amyloid-driven diseases, including treatment-related ARIA in patients with Alzheimer disease exposed to immunotherapy drugs."
34527491,A Difficult and Rare Case of Warfarin Refractory Antiphospholipid Syndrome Presenting With Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome Complicated by Gastrointestinal Bleeding.,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is managed with warfarin for secondary prophylaxis in patients who have had a thrombotic event in the past. Warfarin has been deemed superior to novel oral anticoagulants in preventing venous and arterial thrombosis in conjunction with aspirin. The catastrophic variant of APS (CAPS) is very rarely reported, especially in those who have been on a therapeutic dose of warfarin therapy. We present a rare case of CAPS in a patient with a history of APS who had been on a therapeutic dose of warfarin along with aspirin therapy. The patient is a 70-year-old male with APS diagnosed 30 years prior when he presented with a pulmonary embolism; aspirin was added to warfarin two years ago when he had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented to the hospital with acute onset right-sided weakness and aphasia, left lower extremity pain. He had ischemic CVA, acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.8, anemia with hemoglobin of 3.8, gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) on EGD, with INR of 3.48 cardiolipin IgM of >140g/L. He was transfused packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and provided Vit K. Subsequently, he had a cardiac arrest and was intubated and placed on a mechanical ventilator. Given simultaneous multiorgan involvement, acute arterial and venous thrombosis, the patient was diagnosed with CAPS. The patient was started on high-dose dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and underwent plasma exchange with significant improvement in symptoms, laboratory parameters; and was extubated with near normalization of his speech and motor deficits. He was discharged on enoxaparin and prednisone with sustained clinical improvement two months following discharge. This patient was on the recommended treatment for APS. However, he had presented with a CAPS. This is the first reported case of warfarin refractory CAPS. This case highlights that there might be a subgroup of the population in whom warfarin is not an effective form of treatment modality for an unknown cause, and in fact, it could potently expose a patient to the adverse events related to warfarin therapy as it did in our patient who had significant GIB. This case also highlights the uncommon scenario of spontaneous CAPS with no inciting event as previously reported in the literature, such as infection, recent surgeries, or trauma."
34452956,Phase 3 randomised trial of eltrombopag versus standard first-line pharmacological management for newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopaenia (ITP) in children: study protocol.,"Immune thrombocytopaenia (ITP) is an acquired disorder of low platelets and risk of bleeding. Although many children can be observed until spontaneous remission, others require treatment due to bleeding or impact on health-related quality of life. Standard first-line therapies for those who need intervention include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and anti-D globulin, though response to these agents may be only transient. Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved for children with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or splenectomy. This protocol paper describes an ongoing open-label, randomised trial comparing eltrombopag to standard first-line management in children with newly diagnosed ITP.
Randomised treatment assignment is 2:1 for eltrombopag versus standard first-line management and is stratified by age and by prior treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is platelet response, defined as ≥3 of 4 weeks with platelets >50×10
The study has been approved by the centralised Baylor University Institutional Review Board. The results are expected to be published in 2023.

34448354,Effect of alveolar ridge preservation on clinical attachment level at adjacent teeth: A randomized clinical trial.,"To test whether or not alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) changes the clinical attachment level (CAL) at adjacent teeth of extraction sockets after 6 months.
Seventeen patients requiring bilateral tooth extractions of the upper molars were recruited. After tooth extraction, the sockets were randomly allocated to two groups applying a split-mouth design: (1) ARP using deproteinized bovine bone mineral containing 10% collagen (DBBM-C) covered by a collagen membrane and (2) spontaneous healing (control). CAL, probing pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival recession (REC), and bone levels were evaluated at the adjacent teeth of the extraction sockets at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up.
A total of 14 patients were available for reexamination. From baseline to 6 months of follow-up mean CAL changes of all six sites at adjacent teeth of the extraction sockets amounted to -0.23 ± 0.65 mm (gain) in ARP group and 0.05 ± 0.86 mm (loss) in the control group with significant differences in favor of ARP (p = 0.04). The CAL gain was significantly more favorable at mesiopalatal sites (p = 0.01). Consistently, the mean reduction of PD of all six sites amounted to -0.68 ± 0.84 mm in ARP and -0.34 ± 0.74 mm in the control group (intergroup p = 0.02). The PD reduction was significant (p = 0.001) at the mesiopalatal sites in ARP. BOP, REC, and bone levels showed no significant differences between the groups (intergroup p > 0.05).
Although ARP with DBBM-C revealed a trend toward CAL gain and PD reduction at adjacent teeth of extraction sites, these adjunctive benefits seem to be clinically negligible."
34393407,Oral manifestations of systemic leukemia-first sign of presentation.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy that left untreated or undiagnosed can lead to death within few days. Hence, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment become necessary. Oral manifestations in AML could be the presenting feature or could a part of systemic manifestations. Gingival lesions appear as generalized enlargement with hemorrhagic discoloration with or without spontaneous bleeding. Sometimes, gingival lesions itself could a presenting sign without any other systemic manifesto. We report a similar case which was undiagnosed earlier and the patient came with a complaint of only the gingival swelling."
34391333,Acitretin-induced periungual pyogenic granulomas and review.,"Periungual pyogenic granulomas are benign vascular tumors that present as painful, round, spontaneously bleeding lesions composed of rapidly proliferating capillaries and excess tissue. The vast majority of pyogenic granulomas are caused by physical trauma or infectious agents and they may resolve spontaneously. Herein, we highlight a very rare case of periungual pyogenic granulomas induced by the regularly prescribed oral retinoid acitretin during treatment for congenital palmoplantar keratoderma. This unique case showed that it is feasible to continue acitretin therapy in the presence of pyogenic granuloma development if proper dose reduction and topical therapies are utilized. The patient's lesions resolved within two weeks of this protocol's initiation and the pyogenic granulomas did not recur over the course of a six-month follow-up observation period. In addition, we performed a systematic review of the literature using PubMed databases for the clinical features and treatments in other reported acitretin-induced pyogenic granuloma cases; we compiled a comprehensive list of other prescription drugs known to cause pyogenic granulomas up-to-date."
34326601,Sturge-Weber Syndrome: Roots to a Cure a Nightmare in Pediatric Dentistry.,"This article aims to report a case of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) in a pediatric patient and its systematic dental management to add to the existing literature.
Sturge-Weber syndrome is one of the vascular disorders, known for its stupendous scope of clinical manifestations and life-threatening complications. The substantial prevalence of oral manifestations in SWS makes it crucial to have a comprehensive knowledge of this rare congenital disorder.
This case report represents a case of SWS in an 11-year-old boy with oral, ocular, and neurological features who reported due to pain, unilateral gingival enlargement associated with spontaneous bleeding in the mandibular left region. A multidisciplinary team approach having comprehensive knowledge regarding such rare congenital disorder is a must to prevent its life-threatening complications.
Sturge-Weber syndrome often affects the oral cavity through vascular lesions. Hence, deep knowledge is immensely important to provide an appropriate dental treatment without complications.
Port-wine stains should not be considered as just birthmarks and should be further investigated for its systemic involvement to arrive at a confirmatory diagnosis and treated accordingly with special precautions.

In contrast to adults, diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed in infants due to non-specific symptoms and limited clinical examination.
An 11-month-old female demonstrated symptoms of irritability, intermittent diarrhea, lethargy, decreased oral intake, and difficulties crawling before presenting to the emergency room. At time of presentation, she was noted to have minimal spontaneous movement of the lower extremities and anisocoria with ptosis of the right eye. Given her clinical presentation, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the spine was obtained which revealed an epidural hematoma with compression extending from C7-T3. She underwent C7-T3 laminoplasty and hematoma evacuation. Following surgical intervention, she demonstrated significant improvements in her lower extremity strength and resolution of Horner syndrome.
SSEH in infants is a rare neurologic condition, with diagnosis often delayed due to nonspecific symptomatology. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential in the treatment of SSEH to prevent permanent neurologic dysfunction. Physicians should have a high index of suspicion for SSEH in these instances, and investigation with spinal MRI imaging is recommended."

34152697,Safety of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with advanced liver disease.,"While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in patients with liver disease, safety data especially in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) are limited.
Liver disease patients receiving DOAC treatment (ACLD: n = 104; vascular liver disease: n = 29) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA)/low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; ACLD: n = 45; vascular: n = 13) between January 2010 and September 2020 were retrospectively included. Invasive procedures and bleeding events were recorded. Calibrated anti-Xa peak levels and thrombomodulin-modified thrombin generation assays (TM-TGAs) were measured in a subgroup of 35/28 DOAC patients.
Among patients receiving DOAC, 55 (41.3%) had advanced liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh-stage [CPS] B/C) and 66 (49.6%) had experienced decompensation. Overall, 205 procedures were performed in 60 patients and procedure-related bleedings occurred in 7 (11.7%) patients. Additionally, 38 (28.6%) patients experienced spontaneous (15 minor, 23 major) bleedings during a median follow-up of 10.5 (IQR: 4.0-27.8) months. Spontaneous bleedings in ACLD patients were more common in CPS-B/C (at 12 months: 36.9% vs CPS-A: 15.9%, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]: 3.23 [95% CI: 1.59-6.58], P < .001), as were major bleedings (at 12 months: 22.0% vs 5.0%, SHR: 5.82 [95% CI: 2.00-16.90], P < .001). Importantly, CPS (adjusted SHR: 4.12 [91% CI: 1.82-9.37], P < .001), but not the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma or varices, was independently associated with major bleeding during DOAC treatment. Additionally, ACLD patients experiencing bleeding had worse overall survival (at 12 months: 88.9% vs 95.0% without bleeding; P < .001). Edoxaban anti-Xa peak levels were higher in patients with CPS-B/C (345 [95% CI: 169-395] vs CPS-A: 137 [95% CI: 96-248] ng/mL, P = .048) and were associated with lower TM-TGA. Importantly, spontaneous bleeding rates were comparable to VKA/LMWH patients.
Anticoagulants including DOACs should be used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease due to a significant rate of spontaneous bleeding events."
34129708,"Early implant placement with or without alveolar ridge preservation in single tooth gaps renders similar esthetic, clinical and patient-reported outcome measures: One-year results of a randomized clinical trial.","To test whether early implant placement with alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) results in different esthetic, clinical and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) compared with early implant placement without ARP.
Seventy-five patients requiring single tooth extraction in the anterior maxilla were recruited. Following tooth extraction, the patients were randomly allocated to three groups: (a) ARP using demineralized bovine bone mineral containing 10% collagen (DBBM-C) covered by a collagen matrix (CM) (n = 25), (b) ARP using DBBM-C covered with a palatal graft (PG) (n = 25) and (c) spontaneous healing (control) (n = 25). Eight weeks after tooth extraction, a CBCT was taken and early implant placement was performed in all patients. Esthetic, clinical and PROMs were evaluated one year post-loading.
A total of 70 patients were available for re-examination at one year post-loading. The median mid-facial mucosal margin change amounted to -0.02 mm (IQR -0.27-0.46) in the CM group, -0.13 mm (IQR -0.44-0.25) in the PG group and -0.14 mm (IQR -0.29-0.07) in the control group, with no significant differences between the groups. Mean PES scores amounted to 7.0 ± 1.4 in the CM group, 7.1 ± 1.5 in the PG group and 7.3 ± 1.7 in the control group without significant differences between the groups. Plaque, bleeding on probing and probing depth did not differ between treatment groups. PROMs in general revealed no significant differences between the groups.
Early implant placement with ARP using either a collagen matrix or a palatal graft rendered similar esthetic, clinical and PROMs to early implant placement without ARP. When a failing tooth can be replaced with an implant within 2 months after tooth extraction, the added value of ARP might be clinically negligible."

34080030,"Perampanel, an AMPAR antagonist, alleviates experimental intracerebral hemorrhage‑induced brain injury via necroptosis and neuroinflammation.","Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke with high mortality and morbidity due to the lack of effective therapies. The alpha‑amino‑3‑hydroxy‑5‑methyl‑4‑isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist perampanel has been reported to alleviate early brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury by reducing reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. Necroptosis is a caspase‑independent programmed cell death mechanism that serves a vital role in neuronal cell death following ICH. However, the precise role of necroptosis in perampanel‑mediated neuroprotection following ICH has not been confirmed. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects and potential molecular mechanisms of perampanel in ICH‑induced early brain injury by regulating neural necroptosis in C57BL/6 mice and in a hemin‑induced neuron damage cell culture model. Mortality, neurological score, brain water content, and neuronal death were evaluated. The results demonstrated that perampanel treatment increased the survival rate and neurological score, and increased neuron survival. In addition, perampanel treatment downregulated the protein expression levels of receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase (RIP) 1, RIP3, and mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase, and of the cytokines IL‑1β, IL‑6, TNF‑α, and NF‑κB. These results indicated that perampanel‑mediated inhibition of necroptosis and neuroinflammation ameliorated neuronal death "

34003661,"Device-Related Thrombus After Left Atrial Appendage Closure: Data on Thrombus Characteristics, Treatment Strategies, and Clinical Outcomes From the EUROC-DRT-Registry.","Left atrial appendage closure is an established therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. Although device-related thrombosis (DRT) is relatively rare, it is potentially linked to adverse events. As data on DRT characteristics, outcome, and treatment regimen are scarce, we aimed to assess these questions in a multicenter approach.
One hundred fifty-six patients with the diagnosis of DRT after left atrial appendage closure were included in the multinational EUROC-DRT registry. Baseline characteristics included clinical and echocardiographic data. After inclusion, all patients underwent further clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to assess DRT dynamics, treatment success, and outcome.
DRT was detected after a median of 93 days (interquartile range, 54–161 days) with 17.9% being detected >6 months after left atrial appendage closure. Patients with DRT were at high ischemic and bleeding risk (CHA2DS2-VASc 4.5±1.7, HAS-BLED 3.3±1.2) and had nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation (67.3%), previous stroke (53.8%), and spontaneous echo contrast (50.6%). The initial treatment regimens showed comparable resolution rates (antiplatelet monotherapy: 57.1%, dual antiplatelet therapy: 85.7%, vitamin K antagonists: 80.0%, novel oral anticoagulants: 75.0%, and heparin: 68.6%). After intensification or switch of treatment, complete DRT resolution was achieved in 79.5% of patients. Two-year follow-up revealed a high risk of mortality (20.0%) and ischemic stroke (13.8%) in patients with DRT. Patients with incomplete DRT resolution showed numerically higher stroke rates and increased mortality rates (stroke: 17.6% versus 12.3%, P=0.29; mortality: 31.3% versus 13.1%, P=0.05).
A substantial proportion of DRT is detected >6 months after left atrial appendage closure, highlighting the need for imaging follow-up. Patients with DRT appear to be at a high risk for stroke and mortality. While DRT resolution was achieved in most patients, incomplete DRT resolution appeared to identify patients at even higher risk. Optimal DRT diagnostic criteria and treatment regimens are warranted."
33950207,"Trends in Incidence of Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Association With Antithrombotic Drug Use in Denmark, 2005-2018.","Spontaneous (nontraumatic) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most severe complication of antithrombotic drug use.
To estimate the strength of association between use of antithrombotic drugs and risk of ICH and to examine major changes in the incidence of ICH in the general population.
This case-control study of patients with a first-ever ICH from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2018, matched by age, sex, and calendar year with general population controls (1:40 ratio), assessed case and control patients 20 to 99 years of age in population-based nationwide registries in Denmark (population of 5.8 million).
Use of low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).
Association of ICH with antithrombotic drug use, annual age- and sex-standardized incidence rate of ICH, and prevalence of treatment with antithrombotic drugs. Conditional logistic regression models estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) (95% CIs) for the association of antithrombotic drugs with ICH.
Among 16 765 cases with ICH (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [13.1] years; 8761 [52.3%] male), 7473 (44.6%) were exposed to antithrombotic medications at the time of ICH onset. The association with ICH was weakest for current use of low-dose aspirin (cases: 28.7%, controls: 22.6%; aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.44-1.59) and clopidogrel (cases: 6.2%, controls: 3.4%; aOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.47-1.84) and strongest with current use of a VKA (cases: 12.0%, controls: 5.0%; aOR, 2.76; 95% CI, 2.58-2.96). The association with ICH was weaker for DOACs (cases: 3.0%, controls: 1.8%; aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.61-2.07) than for VKAs. Compared with 2005, the prevalence of use of oral anticoagulants among general population controls in 2018 was higher (3.8% vs 11.1%), predominantly because of increased use of DOACs (DOACs: 0% vs 7.0%; VKA: 3.8% vs 4.2%). Antiplatelet drugs were used less frequently (24.7% vs 21.4%) because of decreased use of low-dose aspirin (24.3% vs 15.3%), whereas clopidogrel use increased (1.0% vs 6.8%). The age- and sex-standardized incidence rate of ICH decreased from 33 per 100 000 person-years in 2005 to 24 per 100 000 person-years in 2018 (P < .001 for trend).
In Denmark from 2005 to 2018, use of antithrombotic drugs, especially VKAs, was associated with ICH. Although use of oral anticoagulation increased substantially during the study period, the incidence rate of ICH decreased."
33888106,Delayed lumbar plexus palsy due to giant psoas hematoma associated with vertebral compression fracture and direct oral anticoagulants: a case report.,"Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are commonly observed in elderly people and can be treated by conservatively with minimal risk of complications in most cases. However, utilization of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) increases the risks of secondary hematoma even after insignificant trauma. The use of DOACs increased over the past decade because of their approval and recommendation for both stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous thromboembolism. It is well known that DOACs are safer anticoagulants than warfarin in terms of major and nonmajor bleeding; however, we noted an increase in the number of bleeding events associated with DOACs that required medical intervention. This report describes the first case of delayed lumbar plexus palsy due to DOAC-associated psoas hematoma after VCF to draw attention to potential risk of severe complication associated with this type of common and stable trauma.
An 83-year-old man presented with his left inguinal pain and inability to ambulate after falling from standing position and was prescribed DOACs for chronic atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography angiography revealed a giant psoas hematoma arising from the ruptured segmental artery running around fractured L4 vertebra. Because of motor weakness of his lower limbs and expansion of psoas hematoma revealed by contrast computed tomography on day 8 of his hospital stay, angiography aimed for transcatheter arterial embolization was tried, but could not demonstrate any major active extravasation; therefore spontaneous hemostasis was expected with heparin replacement. On day 23 of his stay, hematoma turned to decrease, but dysarthria and motor weakness due to left side cerebral infarction occurred. His pain improved and bone healing was achieved about 2 months later from his admission, however the paralysis of the left lower limb and aftereffects of cerebral infarction remained after 1 year.
In patients using DOACs with multiple risk factors, close attention must be taken in vertebral injury even if the fracture itself is a stable-type such as VCF, because segmental artery injury may cause massive psoas hematoma followed by lumbar plexus palsy and other complications."
33883999,Changes in the Size of a Ruptured Pheochromocytoma after Transcatheter Arterial Embolization.,"The spontaneous rupture of a pheochromocytoma is rare and can be potentially fatal. We report a case of a tumor size reduction of a ruptured pheochromocytoma after transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). A 60-year-old Japanese woman was referred to the emergency department of another hospital with a sudden onset of left lateral pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed adrenal hemorrhage with a 5.7 cm adrenal mass, and she was transferred to our hospital for treatment. Considering that she had marked hypertension (193/115 mmHg), we made a provisional diagnosis of left lateral pain due to a ruptured pheochromocytoma. She underwent TAE, and the hemorrhage was successfully controlled. She was started on oral doxazosin for hypertension. The dose of doxazosin was increased to the extent that orthostatic hypotension did not develop, and blood pressure was well controlled. After discharge, the tumor size gradually decreased to approximately 1.0 cm within six months. Six months after TAE, elective laparoscopic surgery was performed, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. We observed a decrease in the size of the ruptured pheochromocytoma after TAE. To reduce the risk of laparoscopic adrenal surgery, it may be useful to monitor the size of a ruptured pheochromocytoma after TAE before deciding the surgery time."
33872382,Progestogens for preventing miscarriage: a network meta-analysis.,"Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. Progesterone has an important role in maintaining a pregnancy, and supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage), and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage).
To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side-effect profile.
We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies.
We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi- and non-randomised trials.
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, to determine the relative effects of all available treatments, but due to the limited number of included studies only direct or indirect comparisons were possible. We estimated the relative effects for the primary outcome of live birth and the secondary outcomes including miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, and adverse drug events. Relative effects for all outcomes are reported separately by the type of miscarriage (threatened and recurrent miscarriage). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
Our meta-analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta-analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. Women with threatened miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta-analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high-certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate-certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. The pre-specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high-certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high-certainty evidence). Women with recurrent miscarriage Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high-certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low-certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. Additional outcomes All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre-specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate-certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate-certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low-certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low-certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens.
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage."
33856168,Mifepristone and Misoprostol for Early Pregnancy Loss and Medication Abortion.,"Medication regimens using mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective for outpatient treatment of early pregnancy loss for up to 84 days' gestation and for medication abortion up to 77 days' gestation. Gestational age is determined using ultrasonography or menstrual history. Ultrasonography is needed when gestational dating cannot be confirmed using clinical data alone or when there are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. The most effective regimens for medication management of early pregnancy loss and medication abortion include 200 mg of oral mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist) followed by 800 mcg of misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue) administered buccally or vaginally. Cramping and bleeding are expected effects of the medications, with bleeding lasting an average of nine to 16 days. The adverse effects of misoprostol (e.g., low-grade fever, gastrointestinal symptoms) can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antiemetics. Ongoing pregnancy, infection, hemorrhage, undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, and the need for unplanned uterine aspiration are rare complications. Clinical history, combined with serial quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels, urine pregnancy testing, or ultrasonography, is used to establish complete passage of the pregnancy tissue."
33775473,[Spontaneous adrenal hematomas. Retrospective analysis of 20 cases from a tertiary center].,"Spontaneous adrenal hemorrhages (AH) are a rare condition with no consensus about their management.
Patients were identified using the Medicalization of the Information System Program database, imaging software and a call for observations to internists, intensivists and obsetricians working at our institution. Adult patients whose medical records were complete and whose diagnosis was confirmed by medical imaging were included.
From 2000 to 2007, 20 patients were identified, including 15 were women. The clinical onset of AH was non-specific. In five cases, AH occurred during pregnancy; four of them were unilateral and right sided. The etiology of the other fifteen (bilateral adrenal hemorrhage in 11) were as follows: antiphospholipid syndrome (n=8), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (n=4), essential thrombocythemia (n=3), spontaneous AH due to oral anticoagulants (n=1), complication of a surgical act (n=3), and sepsis (n=3). In seven cases, two causes were concomitant. The diagnosis of AH was often confirmed by abdominal CT. An anticoagulant treatment was initiated in 16 cases. Ten of the eleven patients presenting with bilateral adrenal hematomas were treated using a long-term substitute opotherapy. One patient died because of a catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.
The clinical onset of HS is heterogeneous and non-specific. The confirmatory diagnosis is often based on abdominal CT. The search for an underlying acquired thrombophilia is essential and we found in this study etiological data comparable to the main series in the literature. Adrenal insufficiency is most of the time definitive in cases of bilateral involvement."
33774945,Effect Of Justicia Adhatoda (Malabar Nut) Leaf Extract On Drug-Induced Coagulopathy In Mice And In-Vitro Platelet Aggregation Of Human Blood.,"Justicia adhatoda is widely used in traditional medicine for treatment of menorrhagia, piles and bleeding disorders. Oral antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs are routinely prescribed to patients with cardiovascular diseases. These drugs have one major adverse effect that they can cause spontaneous haemorrhage, which can be fatal. Development of a haemostatic agent can help in effective management of drug-induced haemorrhages. This study was devised to observe the effect of leaf extract of Justicia adhatoda on coagulation profile in mice and to evaluate its effect on in-vitro platelet aggregation.
The study was divided into two parts. First part was designed to evaluate the effect of J. adhatoda leaf extract on coagulation parameters. Three drugs were used to induce coagulopathy viz., warfarin, aspirin and dabigatran. Bleeding time, platelet count, PT and APTT were estimated. Second part of this study was devised to observe the effect of J. adhatoda leaf extract on in vitro platelet aggregation of human. Percent aggregation was recorded by light transmission aggregometer for three minutes.
Leaf extract of Justicia adhatoda decreased bleeding time from 6.1±2.36 minutes in normal control to 1.9±1.03 minutes in extract treated mice. There was no effect on the coagulation parameters. Platelet count increased significantly only in the aspirin treated group that received the extract to 540±46.8x103 /μl from 436.9±37.9x103 /μl of aspirin treated group. Platelet aggregation in vitro increased in a dose dependent manner.
Justicia adhatoda leaf extract is effective in controlling excessive bleeding in vivo, in mice with acquired platelet defect produced by aspirin. This haemostatic effect is probably due to increased platelet aggregation as indicated by the in vitro results."
33689049,Prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma metastasizing to the oral cavity.,"Oral metastasis by hepatocellular carcinoma (OMHCC) is extremely rare, and the prognosis had been reported quite poor due to simultaneous multiple organ metastases. In this study, we report clinical features and survival of 10 new cases of OMHCC and suggest the criteria for palliative surgery.
A retrospective clinical study including 10 new cases of oral OMHCC between 2006 and 2016 was performed. Clinical features and survival analysis were examined. The recorded variables were age, sex, site of oral metastases, size of oral tumor (largest diameter), and survival after oral histopathologic diagnosis.
There was male (n=8) predilection of OMHCC. The mean survival time was 16.9 months. Patient age ranged from 40 to 71 years (mean 56.5). Eight mandibular and two maxillary lesions were found. One patient showed simultaneously the maxilla and the oral tongue involvement. The most often encountered symptoms were swelling (80%) followed by pain (60%), numbness (60%), bleeding (10%), and tooth mobility (10%). Four patients underwent operation due to spontaneous bleeding and swelling of the cancer. Overall (from onset of hepatocellular carcinoma) and truncated survival (from onset of OMHCC) were 71.9 and 13.1 months respectively.
The prognosis of OMHCC was quite poor. Oral and jaw bone examination should be included in patients with multiple metastasis of HCC. Palliative surgery might be performed in patients who reported spontaneous bleeding, severe pain, and oral dysphasia due to tumor enlargement."
33646603,Adverse drug reactions with oral anticoagulants: data from sicilian spontaneous reporting system database.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed to avoid the limitations of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). DOACs are associated with a greater incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and a smaller number of intracranial haemorrhages than VKAs. Therefore, it is important to deepen our knowledge of their safety profiles. The aim of this study was thus to analyse adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports on DOACs and VKAs using the Sicilian Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) database.
All ADR reports with DOACs and VKAs as suspected drugs that were entered into the Sicilian SRS database during the period 2001-2019 were selected. In detail, all reports with the following single active substances were included: dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban; acenocoumarol and warfarin were included as a comparator group. Descriptive statistical methodology was used to evaluate characteristics of the reported cases with a case-by-case assessment.
Out of 521 reports related to anticoagulants, 444 (85.2%) and 77 (14.8%) involved DOACs and VKAs, respectively. DOAC-related reports were mainly of gastrointestinal disorders. In contrast, VKAs were mostly associated with blood and lymphatic system disorders, injury, investigations and vascular disorders. Many more cases of ADRs in the form of gastrointestinal disorders concerned dabigatran etexilate (n = 179, 73.7%) than the other DOACs, while ADRs in the form of blood disorders were mainly associated with acenocoumarol (n = 27, 57.4%). The most commonly reported Preferred Terms for DOACs were dyspepsia (n = 89, 17.1%), upper abdominal pain (n = 41, 9.2%) and pruritus (n = 26, 5.8%), whereas for VKAs, they were anaemia (n = 21, 27.3%) and hypocoagulable state (n = 18, 3.5%). Potentially interacting concomitant medications particularly included antithrombotic agents (n = 19, 4.3%) for DOACs and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) (n = 37, 48.1%) and antithrombotic agents (n = 13, 16.9%) for VKAs.
The ADRs most commonly associated with DOACs, especially dabigatran, were gastrointestinal disorders, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding. Our study also highlights the potential role of drug-drug interactions in the ADRs. The cases of gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the need for careful prescribing of DOACs and use of potentially interacting concomitant drugs."
33629014,To treat or not to treat: left ventricular thrombus in a patient with cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a case report.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an important cause of cognitive impairment and spontaneous lobar intracerebral haemorrhage in older individuals. When necessary, anticoagulant treatment in these patients comes with two dilemmas; significant intracerebral bleeding risk with treatment vs. high risk of embolic stroke with no treatment.
A 66-year-old female patient presented to the emergency clinic with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Her past medical history revealed cognitive problems associated with lobar cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging suspect for probable CAA. A primary percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending artery with implantation of drug eluting stent was performed. Dual antiplatelet treatment was started initially. During hospitalization, an impaired left ventricular (LV) function was observed with an apical aneurysm. Six months after the initial event, LV function remained stable however a LV thrombus was observed. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was started based on multidisciplinary consensus and on its efficacy and safety profile in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite treatment, patient suffered a new ischaemic stroke probably from the LV thrombus, for which vitamin K antagonist treatment was initiated and Apixaban discontinued.
Evidence for LV thrombus treatment with direct oral anticoagulants in CAA patients is scarce, however feasible based on its efficacy and safety profile. For CAA patients, the cardinal role of both clinical and radiological characteristics in determining the risk-benefit ratio for anticoagulant initiation in this specific subset of patients, is crucial. The clinical course described highlights the therapeutical dilemma of coexisting CAA and the clinical challenge it creates."
33614342,Tongue Hematoma With Necrosis.,"Spontaneous tongue hematoma is a known rare adverse side effect associated with warfarin therapy. There is a long list of drug-to-drug interactions with warfarin that may contribute to a rise in international normalized ratio (INR) levels, increasing the risk of bleeding. We present a case of an elderly female patient who presented with oral dysphagia and spontaneous oral cavity bleeding while on warfarin therapy. She was found to have tongue hematoma and necrosis. A week prior she started treatment with topical miconazole for oral candidiasis and a few days later topical clarithromycin was added. Treatment given was mainly supportive with intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and aminocaproic acid. Full recovery was achieved. It is our intention to raise awareness of a rare adverse side effect related to warfarin therapy that may have been precipitated with the use of medications known to contribute to INR elevation. As learning points, we emphasize close monitoring of INR levels when using known drug-to-drug interactions with warfarin and also consider replacing warfarin for a direct oral anticoagulant if no contraindication is present."
33510917,Cardiopulmonary Arrest with Airway Obstruction due to Postoperative Bleeding.,"An 84-year-old woman underwent soft palate resection and skin grafting with tie-over under general anesthesia. Fourteen years previously, she had undergone aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting followed by lifelong warfarin and aspirin anticoagulation. We terminated the two drugs 8 and 6 days, respectively, before the present surgery and substituted intravenous heparin (10,000 units/day), which was terminated 6 h preoperatively. The surgery was uneventful. Heparin was restarted 2 days postoperatively but without warfarin potassium or aspirin because of postoperative soft palate bleeding, which continued for 10 days despite compression hemostasis. On day 10, she exhibited a suffocating large hemorrhagic mass, leading to cardiopulmonary arrest. Emergency consultation with medical doctors and dental anesthetists resulted in pulmonary resuscitation and tracheal intubation. After confirming spontaneous circulation/respiration, she was transferred to the intensive care unit. We now consider it essential that all medical/surgical/anesthesia specialists managing patients under anticoagulant therapy collaborate perioperatively."
33476659,Timing and efficacy of mifepristone pretreatment for medical management of early pregnancy loss.,"To determine the time interval between mifepristone and misoprostol administration associated with the most efficacious early pregnancy loss (EPL) management.
We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized trial. Participants with EPL were instructed to take 200 mg oral mifepristone followed by 800 mcg vaginal misoprostol 24 hours later. The primary outcome was gestational sac expulsion at the first follow-up visit (1-4 days after misoprostol use) after a single dose of misoprostol and no additional intervention within 30 days after treatment. Despite specification of drug timing, participants used the medication over a range of time. We graphed sliding average estimates of success and assessed the proportion of treatment successes over time to define timing interval cohorts for analysis. We used multivariable generalized linear regression to assess the association between time interval and success.
Of 139 eligible participants, 70 (50.4%) self-administered misoprostol before 24 hours, and 69 (49.6%) at or after 24 hours. We defined the following time intervals: 0 to 6 hours (n = 22); 7 to 20 hours (n = 29); and 21 to 48 hours (n = 88). Success occurred in 96.6% of the 7- to 20-hour cohort compared to 54.6% and 87.5% of the cohorts self-administering misoprostol earlier or later, respectively. When adjusting for race, gestational age, diagnosis, bleeding at presentation, insurance status, and enrollment site, participants administering misoprostol between 0 and 6 hours (adjusted risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.85) and 21 to 48 hours (adjusted risk ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) had a lower risk of success when compared to participants administering 7 to 20 hours after mifepristone.
These data suggest that medical management of EPL has the highest likelihood of success when misoprostol is self-administered 7 to 20 hours after mifepristone.
These preliminary data suggest that patients have the highest likelihood of success when misoprostol is taken between 7 and 20 hours after mifepristone. In contrast with medical abortion, simultaneous medication administration may not be as effective as delayed. Future research is needed to confirm the optimal medication time interval."
33470152,Restart TICrH: An Adaptive Randomized Trial of Time Intervals to Restart Direct Oral Anticoagulants after Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage.,"Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis and death in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) but also increase bleeding risk. The benefit/risk ratio favors anticoagulation in most of these patients. However, some will have a bleeding complication, such as the common trip-and-fall brain injury in elderly patients that results in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Clinicians must then make the difficult decision about when to restart the anticoagulant. Restarting too early risks making the bleeding worse. Restarting too late risks thrombotic events such as ischemic stroke and VTE, the indications for anticoagulation in the first place. There are more data on restarting patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, which is very different than traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage increases the risk of rebleeding because intrinsic vascular changes are widespread and irreversible. In contrast, traumatic cases are caused by a blow to the head, usually an isolated event portending less future risk. Clinicians generally agree that anticoagulation should be restarted but disagree about when. This uncertainty leads to long restart delays causing a large, potentially preventable burden of strokes and VTE, which has been unaddressed because of the absence of high quality evidence. Restart Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (the ""r"" distinguished intracranial from intracerebral) (TICrH) is a prospective randomized open label blinded end-point response-adaptive clinical trial that will evaluate the impact of delays to restarting direct oral anticoagulation (1, 2, or 4 weeks) on the composite of thrombotic events and bleeding in patients presenting after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage."
33446422,Intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving anticoagulation with warfarin or edoxaban: An in-depth analysis from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 randomized trial.,"Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a known risk of oral anticoagulation; delineating ICH attributes may provide nuanced guidance regarding atrial fibrillation management. We evaluated ICH characteristics and outcomes from Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48), a randomized trial that compared two edoxaban regimens (higher-dose edoxaban regimen 60/30 mg (HDER), lower-dose edoxaban regimen 30/15 mg (LDER)) with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients who suffered ICH vs those who did not were compared and independent predictors of ICH were calculated. We also assessed ICH subtype and etiology. Of 21,105 randomized patients, 322 (1.53%) had ≥ 1 ICH for a total of 368 events. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (HDER: HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.35-0.77], LDER: HR 0.22 [0.13-0.38]) and subdural hematoma (HDER: HR 0.29 [0.15-0.55], LDER: HR 0.26 [0.13-0.50]) were lower with both HDER and LDER vs warfarin. Subarachnoid hemorrhage frequency was similar in the HDER vs warfarin groups but lower in LDER. Compared to warfarin, edoxaban was associated with lower risk of spontaneous ICH (HDER: HR 0.47 [0.31-0.69], LDER: HR 0.34 [0.22-0.53]) and traumatic ICH (HDER: HR 0.32 [0.17-0.61], LDER: HR 0.31 [0.16-0.59]). In multivariable analysis, randomization to warfarin, increased age, and risk of falling remained independent predictors of ICH. In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, ICH was decreased in edoxaban-treated patients compared to warfarin-treated patients, including ICH of both spontaneous and traumatic causes. Both edoxaban regimens lowered intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages compared to warfarin. Patient characteristics and medical history may help guide anticoagulation management."
33423695,Surgical treatment for antiplatelet intracerebral hemorrhage (SAP-ICH): protocol for a prospective cohort study of emergency surgery for severe spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients on long-term oral antiplatelet treatment.,"Despite the capability of emergency surgery to reduce the mortality of severe spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (SSICH) patients, the effect and safety of surgical treatment for severe spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (SSICH) patients receiving long-term oral antiplatelet treatment (LOAPT) remains unclear. In consideration of this, the cohort study is aimed at figuring out the effect and safety of emergency surgery for SSICH patients on LOAPT.
As a multicenter and prospective cohort study, it will be conducted across 7 representative clinical centers. Starting in September 2019, the observation is scheduled to be completed by December 2022, with a total of 450 SSICH patients recruited. The information on clinical, radiological, and laboratory practices will be recorded objectively. All of the patients will be monitored until death or 6 months after the occurrence of primary hemorrhage.
In this study, two comparative cohorts and an observational cohort will be set up. The primary outcome is the effect of emergency surgery, which is subject to assessment using the total mortality and comparison in the survival rate of SSICH patients on LOAPT between surgical treatment and conservative treatment. The second outcome is the safety of surgery, with the postoperative hemorrhagic complication which is compared between the operated SSICH patients on and not on LOAPT. Based on the observation of the characteristics and outcome of SSICH patients on LOAPT, the ischemic events after discontinuing LOAPT will be further addressed, and the coagulation function assessment system for operated SSICH patients on LOAPT will be established.
In this study, we will investigate the effect and safety of emergency surgery for SSICH patients on LOAPT, which will provide an evidence for management in the future.
The research protocol and informed consent in this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Tiantan Hospital (KY2019-096-02). The results of this study are expected to be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals in 2023.

33421158,The Use of Rifaximin in Patients With Cirrhosis.,"Rifaximin is an oral nonsystemic antibiotic with minimal gastrointestinal absorption and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Rifaximin is currently used worldwide in patients with cirrhosis for preventing recurrent HE because its efficacy and safety have been proven by large randomized clinical trials. In the last decade, experimental and clinical evidence suggest that rifaximin could have other beneficial effects on the course of cirrhosis by modulating the gut microbiome and affecting the gut-liver axis, which in turn can interfere with major events of the pathophysiological cascade underlying decompensated cirrhosis, such as systemic inflammatory syndrome, portal hypertension, and bacterial infections. However, the use of rifaximin for prevention or treatment of other complications, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other bacterial infections, is not accepted because evidence by clinical trials is still very weak. The present review deals in the first part with the potential impact of rifaximin on pathogenic mechanisms in liver diseases, whereas in the second part, its clinical effects are critically discussed. It clearly emerges that, because of its potential activity on multiple pathogenic events, the efficacy of rifaximin in the prevention or management of complications other than HE deserves to be investigated extensively. The results of double-blinded, adequately powered randomized clinical trials assessing the effect of rifaximin, alone or in combination with other drugs, on hard clinical endpoints, such as decompensation of cirrhosis, acute-on-chronic liver failure, and mortality, are therefore eagerly awaited."
33392334,Status epilepticus as an initial manifestation of hepatic encephalopathy: A case report.,"Status epilepticus in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a rare but serious condition that is refractory to antiepileptic drugs, and current treatment plans are vague. Diagnosis may be difficult without a clear history of cirrhosis. Liver transplantation (LT) is effective to alleviate symptoms, however, there are few reports about LT in the treatment of status epilepticus with HE. To our knowledge, this is the first report of status epilepticus present as initial manifestation of HE.
A 59-year-old woman with a 20-year history of heavy drinking was hospitalized for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She reported no history of episodes of HE, stroke, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ascites or gastrointestinal bleeding. Neurological examination revealed a comatose patient, without papilledema. Laboratory examination suggested liver cirrhosis. Plasma ammonia levels upon admission were five times normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) was normal, while abdominal CT and ultrasound revealed mild ascites, liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly. Electroencephalography (EEG)showed diffuse slow waves rhythm, consistent with HE, and sharp waves during ictal EEG corresponding to clinical semiology of focal tonic seizures. The symptoms were reversed by continuous antiepileptic treatment and lactulose. She was given oral levetiracetam, and focal aware seizures occasionally affected her 10 mo after LT.
Status epilepticus could be an initial manifestation of HE. Antiepileptic drugs combined with lactulose are essential for treatment of status epilepticus with HE, and LT is effective to prevent the relapse."
33376233,Valproic Acid-Induced Thrombocytopenia-Related Spontaneous Systemic Bleeding.,"BACKGROUND Valproic acid is utilized for the management of various disease states, but coagulation changes, such as thrombocytopenia, can limit use. Valproic acid is a highly protein-bound drug. Serum levels of 50-100 mcg/mL are considered therapeutic, with minimal risk of toxicity when maintained within the recommended therapeutic index. We present a case of valproic acid-induced thrombocytopenia associated with spontaneous systemic bleeding. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman with history of generalized anxiety disorder and choreiform movements presented to the Emergency Department with 1 day of oral and vaginal bleeding. The patient had been started on valproic acid for choreiform movements 3 weeks prior. On physical exam, the patient was noted to have atraumatic contusions and ecchymosis. A CT head revealed left temporal frontal subdural hematoma (4.5 mm), acute subdural hematoma along the posterior aspect of the interhemispheric falx (5 mm), mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, and an approximately 3 mm right-to-left midline shift. Laboratory testing was notable for platelets 4000/μL, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 23.1%, fibrinogen 467 mg/dL, and valproic acid random level 26.3 μg/mL. Thromboelastography releveled normal values except for a decreased maximum amplitude of 33.4 mm. CONCLUSIONS Although the clinical relevance is still debated, few case reports of significant bleeding related to valproic acid-induced thrombocytopenia exist. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of spontaneous systemic bleeding due to valproic acid-induced thrombocytopenia in the setting of normal fibrinogen levels. Furthermore, this report demonstrates the potential risk of thrombocytopenia with subtherapeutic VPA levels."
33351124,Intracranial hemorrhage with direct oral anticoagulants in patients with brain metastases.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly prescribed in treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis, but limited data exist regarding safety of DOACs in patients with brain metastases. We aimed to determine the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with brain metastases receiving DOACs or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. An international 2-center retrospective cohort study was designed. Follow-up started on the first day of concomitant anticoagulation and brain tumor diagnosis. At least 2 brain imaging studies were mandated. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of any spontaneous ICH at 12-month follow-up with death as a competing risk. Major ICH was defined as spontaneous, ≥10 mL in volume, symptomatic, or requiring surgical intervention. Imaging studies were centrally reviewed by a neuroradiologist blinded for anticoagulant type. PANWARDS (platelets, albumin, no congestive heart failure, warfarin, age, race, diastolic blood pressure, stroke) score for prediction of ICH was calculated. We included 96 patients with brain metastases (41 DOAC, 55 LMWH). The 12-month cumulative incidence of major ICH was 5.1% in DOAC-treated patients and 11.1% in those treated with LMWH (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-2.21). When anticoagulation was analyzed as a time-varying covariate, the risk of any ICH did not differ between DOAC- and LMWH-treated patients (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.28-3.40). PANWARDS score was not associated with ICH risk. This international 2-center study suggests comparable safety of LMWH and DOACs in patients with brain metastases."
33331637,Use of oral progestogen in women with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester: a randomized double-blind controlled trial.,"Will use of oral progestogen in women with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester reduce the miscarriage rate when compared with placebo?
Use of oral progestogen in women with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester did not reduce miscarriage before 20 weeks when compared with placebo.
Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy and occurs in 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Use of vaginal progestogens is not effective in reducing miscarriage but there is still no good evidence to support use of oral progestogen for the treatment of threatened miscarriage.
This was a randomized double-blind controlled trial. A total of 406 women presenting with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester were recruited from 30 March 2016 to May 2018.
Women attending Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinics because of vaginal bleeding during the first trimester were recruited and randomly assigned to use dydrogesterone 40 mg orally, followed by 10 mg orally three times a day or placebo until 12 completed weeks of gestation or 1 week after the bleeding stopped, whichever was later. The primary outcome was the miscarriage rate before 20 weeks of gestation.
The two groups of women had comparable age, BMI, number of previous miscarriages, gestation and ultrasound findings at presentation. The miscarriage rate before 20 weeks of gestation was similar in both groups, being 12.8% (26/203) in the progestogen group and 14.3% (29/203) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.897, 95% CI 0.548-1.467; P = 0.772). The live birth rate was 81.3% in the progestogen group versus 83.3% in the placebo group (P = 0.697). No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of obstetric outcomes and side effects.
The primary outcome was the miscarriage rate, rather than the live birth rate. Women were recruited from Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinics and those with heavy vaginal bleeding might be admitted into wards directly instead of attending Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic. The severity of vaginal bleeding was subjectively graded by women themselves. The sample size was not adequate to demonstrate a smaller difference in the miscarriage rate between the progestogen and placebo groups. We did not exclude women with multiple pregnancy, which increased the risk of miscarriage although there was only one set of twin pregnancy in the placebo group.
Use of oral progestogen is not recommended in women with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester.

33313417,Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials.,"Anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICrH) is a devastating injury with high morbidity and mortality. For survivors, treating clinicians face the dilemma of restarting oral anticoagulation with scarce evidence to guide them. Thromboembolic risk is high from the bleeding event, patients' high baseline risks, that is, the pre-existing indication for anticoagulation, and the risk of immobility after the bleeding episode. This must be balanced with potentially devastating hematoma expansion or new hemorrhagic lesions. Retrospective evidence and expert opinion support restarting oral anticoagulants in most patients with tICrH, but timing is uncertain. Researchers have failed to make clear distinctions between tICrH and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICrH), which have differing natural histories. While both appear to benefit from restarting, sICrH has a higher rebleeding risk and similar or lower thrombotic risk. Clinical equipoise on restarting is also divergent. In sICrH, equipoise is centered on whether to restart. In tICrH, it is centered on when. Several prospective randomized clinical trials are ongoing or about to start to examine the risk-benefit of restarting. Most of them are restricted to patients with sICrH, with antiplatelet control groups. Most are also restricted to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they are associated with a lower overall risk of ICrH. There is some overlap with tICrH via subdural hematoma, and one trial is specific to restart timing with DOACs in only traumatic cases. This is a narrative review of the current evidence for restarting anticoagulation and restart timing after tICrH along with a summary of the ongoing and planned clinical trials."
33299625,Acute Vitreous and Intraretinal Hemorrhage with Multifocal Subretinal Fluid in Juvenile X-Linked Retinoschisis.,"To report a rare case of spontaneous vitreous and intraretinal hemorrhage in a patient with juvenile X-linked retinoschisis which was managed conservatively.
Single patient case report.
Juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (JXLR) most often occurs as a result of a genetic defect in the retinoschisin (RS1) gene, causing a separation between the ganglion cell layer and the nerve fiber layer. Spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage has been reported as an uncommon secondary consequence of JXLR. We present a case of spontaneous vitreous and diffuse macular intraretinal hemorrhages in a patient with JXLR which resolved with medical management alone.
A 23-year-old man with a history of juvenile X-linked retinoschisis presented to the ophthalmic emergency room complaining of acute onset of floaters in his right eye. On examination, the patient was found to have a new vitreous hemorrhage with diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages in his right eye, without new retinal tears or detachment. SD-OCT demonstrated multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid. The genetic testing panel revealed a hemizygous mutation in the RS-1 gene. He was managed conservatively on oral acetazolamide, with the resolution of the subretinal fluid and with both visual and symptomatic improvement.
Spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage may rarely occur in patients with JXLR, even in the absence of acute retinal tear or detachment. This case demonstrates an atypical presentation of vitreous hemorrhage with diffuse intraretinal hemorrhage and new multifocal areas of subretinal fluid which improved without surgical intervention. Good outcomes may be achieved in these patients with conservative management alone, even in atypical presentations."
33274855,Naoxueshu relieves hematoma after clot removal in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Surgical treatment is expected to remove clot immediately in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Naoxueshu could enhance the efficacy of clot removal surgery in acute SICH patients.
One hundred twenty patients who had been diagnosed as SICH according to neuroimaging were enrolled in this study. They received craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, or minimally invasive surgical evacuation as appropriate and then were randomized into two groups: the Naoxueshu group (NXS group, n = 60) and the control group (n = 60). All the patients received standard medical management while patients in NXS group also took Naoxueshu oral liquid 10 ml with three times a day for seven consecutive days. The primary outcome was the 7-day hematoma volume and secondary outcomes were 7-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and 7-day cerebral edema score.
After clot removal surgery, hematoma volume in NXS group (9.5 ± 8.0) was significantly decreased than that in Control group (21.3 ± 22.9, p < .0001) 7 days after surgery. Moreover, cerebral edema was also relieved after 7-day's Naoxueshu treatment (2.5 ± 0.9 vs. 2.9 ± 0.7, p = .043). Since patients in NXS group had worse baseline NIHSS score (17.2 ± 8.1 vs. 13.7 ± 10.1, p = .039), it was reasonable to conclude that Naoxueshu treatment could improve patients' neurological function because 7-day NIHSS score of the two groups was similar.
Naoxueshu oral liquid could relieve hematoma volume and cerebral edema after clot removal surgery in acute SICH patients. Moreover, it had the potential to improve patients' short-term neurological function."
33237372,Postorthodontic lower incisor and canine inclination and labial gingival recession in adult patients : A prospective study.,"The goal was to determine whether changes in the inclination of lower incisors and canines upon orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances poses a threat for labial gingival recession in adult patients.
The sample of this prospective clinical trial consisted of 32 adult patients (mean age 25.08 ±6.50 years) treated with fixed appliances. Plaque and bleeding indices, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, gingival recession height (GR) and width (GRW), gingival thickness (GT), and keratinized tissue width were clinically recorded, while cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to evaluate teeth inclination before (T1) and after treatment (T2). Oral hygiene, brushing habits, and smoking were controlled.
During orthodontic treatment on 15 (8.33%) teeth (10 incisors and 5 canines), spontaneous complete improvement of pre-existing GR was observed. On 2 incisors, GR decreased and on 3 teeth GR did not change. Moreover, 1 incisor presented an increased GR, while 2 teeth developed new defects. Mean GR, GRW, and GT decreased significantly only on the incisors. Proclination of incisors and canines during treatment (compared with retroclination of the teeth) implicated a lower reduction in GR at T2: 0.19 mm (p = 0.034) and 0.18 mm (p = 0.037), respectively. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that more tooth proclination was associated with a higher risk for an increase in GR (p < 0.00).
Properly planned changes in lower incisor and canine inclination can be carried out in adult patients without posing a high risk to labial gingival recessions if the individual periodontal biotype is respected. The reported outcomes underscore the orthodontic principle to keep tooth roots inside the alveolar bone.
ZIELSETZUNG: Ziel war es, festzustellen, ob Veränderungen in der Neigung der unteren Schneide- und Eckzähne nach einer kieferorthopädischen Behandlung mit festsitzenden Apparaturen eine Gefahr für eine labiale gingivale Rezession bei erwachsenen Patienten darstellen.
Die Stichprobe dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie bestand aus 32 erwachsenen, mit festsitzenden Apparaturen behandelten Patienten (Durchschnittsalter 25,08 ±6,50 Jahre). Plaque- und Blutungsindizes, Sondierungstiefe, klinischer Attachmentlevel, Höhe (GR) und Breite (GRW) der gingivalen Rezession, gingivale Dicke (GT) und Breite des keratinisierten Gewebes wurden klinisch erfasst, während die digitale Volumentomographie (DVT) zur Beurteilung der Zahnneigung vor (T1) und nach der Behandlung (T2) eingesetzt wurde. Mundhygiene, Zahnputzgewohnheiten und Rauchen wurden kontrolliert.
Während der kieferorthopädischen Behandlung an 15 (8,33%) Zähnen (10 Schneide-, 5 Eckzähne) wurde eine spontane vollständige Verbesserung der bereits vorhandenen GR beobachtet. Bei 2 Schneidezähnen nahm die GR ab und bei 3 Zähnen veränderte sich die GR nicht. Darüber hinaus wies ein Frontzahn eine erhöhte GR auf, während bei 2 Zähnen neue Defekte auftraten. Die mittlere GR, GRW und GT nahmen nur bei den Schneidezähnen signifikant ab. Die Proklination der Schneidezähne und der Eckzähne während der Behandlung (im Vergleich zur Retroklination) bedeutete eine geringere Abnahme der GR bei T2: 0,19 mm (p = 0,034) bzw. 0,18 mm (p = 0,037). Eine multiple Regressionsanalyse bestätigte, dass mehr Proklination mit einem höheren Risiko für eine Erhöhung der GR verbunden war (p < 0,00).
Angemessen geplante Veränderungen der unteren Schneidezahn- und Eckzahnneigung können bei erwachsenen Patienten durchgeführt werden, ohne dass ein hohes Risiko für labiale Gingivarezessionen besteht, wenn der individuelle parodontale Biotyp respektiert wird. Die berichteten Ergebnisse unterstreichen das kieferorthopädische Prinzip, die Zahnwurzeln innerhalb des Alveolarknochens zu halten."
33236823,Oral manifestations of COVID-19 disease: A review article.,"Dysgeusia is the first recognized oral symptom of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this review article, we described oral lesions of COVID-19 patients. We searched PubMed library and Google Scholar for published literature since December 2019 until September 2020. Finally, we selected 35 articles including case reports, case series and letters to editor. Oral manifestations included ulcer, erosion, bulla, vesicle, pustule, fissured or depapillated tongue, macule, papule, plaque, pigmentation, halitosis, whitish areas, hemorrhagic crust, necrosis, petechiae, swelling, erythema, and spontaneous bleeding. The most common sites of involvement in descending order were tongue (38%), labial mucosa (26%), and palate (22%). Suggested diagnoses of the lesions were aphthous stomatitis, herpetiform lesions, candidiasis, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like, EM-like, mucositis, drug eruption, necrotizing periodontal disease, angina bullosa-like, angular cheilitis, atypical Sweet syndrome, and Melkerson-Rosenthal syndrome. Oral lesions were symptomatic in 68% of the cases. Oral lesions were nearly equal in both genders (49% female and 51% male). Patients with older age and higher severity of COVID-19 disease had more widespread and sever oral lesions. Lack of oral hygiene, opportunistic infections, stress, immunosuppression, vasculitis, and hyper-inflammatory response secondary to COVID-19 are the most important predisposing factors for onset of oral lesions in COVID-19 patients."
33226545,Hemorrhage Risk Profiles among Different Antithrombotic Regimens: Evidence from a Real-World Analysis of Postmarketing Surveillance Data.,"Although the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has been reported in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), there is currently no consensus on the occurrence or characteristics of the hemorrhage risk in different antithrombotic regimens.
Disproportionality and Bayesian analyses were performed in mining data of suspected hemorrhagic events after antithrombotic drug use from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from January 2004 to September 2019. The time to onset and fatality rate of hemorrhage following different antithrombotic regimens were also compared.
A total of 84,998 reports of hemorrhage-related adverse events with the use of antithrombotic drugs were identified. The patients included were mostly from the Americas (80.87%) and Europe (13.22%), with most data submitted by nonhealthcare professionals. Among the seven antithrombotic drug monotherapies, betrixaban had the highest association with hemorrhage based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR, 829.95; 95% CI = 113.61-6063.15), proportional reporting ratio (PRR, 24.68, χ2 = 804.24), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS, 24.68, 95% one-sided CI = 4.67). The combination therapies of clopidogrel plus new oral anticoagulants had higher RORs, PRRs, and empirical Bayesian geometric means (EBGMs) than the antithrombotic drug monotherapies. Hemorrhage associated with rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel appeared to have an earlier onset (171 days vs 219 days, 95% two-sided CI =68.68-27.34, p < 0.0001) and a lower fatality rate (15.30% vs 17.74%, p<0.05) than that associated with rivaroxaban monotherapy.
This study provides a relevant overview of the hemorrhagic complications/fatalities associated with different antithrombotic regimens in their real-world use. Among the combination therapies, clopidogrel plus DOACs were found to have stronger associations with hemorrhage than traditional dual antithrombotic therapies. Rivaroxaban showed a stronger association with hemorrhage than other antithrombotic drug monotherapies, and apixaban monotherapy appeared to have weaker associations with hemorrhage than others."
33167757,Comprehensive Treatment Strategy for Internal Carotid Artery Blowout Syndrome Caused by Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.,"To evaluate a treatment strategy for internal carotid artery blowout syndrome caused by nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
A retrospective analysis of a case series was performed.
Carotid blowout syndrome is a catastrophic complication caused by malignant tumor of the skull base.
A retrospective analysis based on 69 patients with internal carotid artery blowout syndrome admitted to our center between April 2018 and January 2020 was performed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: an EBBA (internal carotid artery embolization + bypass based on American Society of Intervention and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology [ASITN/SIR]) group and an embolization/stent group. The follow-up time was 6 to 9 months.
In the EBBA group, 41 patients (41/49, 83.7%) survived. Forty patients had a satisfactory quality of life after 3 months. No death occurred within 3 months. Nonoperative death occurred in 8 cases (8/49, 16.3%). The rate of mortality and disability was 18.4% (9/49). In the embolization/stent group, 16 patients (16/20, 80%) survived. Nonoperative death occurred in 4 cases (4/20, 20%), 3 of which occurred within 1 to 3 months. Four cases reported Modified Rankin Scale ≥2 after 3 months. The rate of mortality and disability was 40% (8/20).
A comprehensive revascularization strategy for internal carotid artery (ICA) embolization and intracranial and extracranial bypass grafting based on ASITN/SIR score for ICA blowout syndrome patients not only can prolong the patient survival but also greatly improve the survival probability and quality of life as well as reduce their rate of mortality or disability."
33150098,A Case Report on an Extremely Rare Disease: Factor XI Deficiency.,"Factor XI deficiency is a rare condition with an estimated prevalence of about one in one million and is more commonly seen in Ashkenazi Jews (8-9%) due to consanguinity. It occurs because of mutations in the factor XI gene (F11) on chromosome 4(4q35). Patients with this disorder may remain asymptomatic until they undergo any surgical procedure or delivery. The most common sites of bleeding include the oral cavity, pharynx, and genitourinary tract, where there is high fibrinolytic activity. Our patient was asymptomatic his whole life. He never had spontaneous bleeding or bruising; however, he had severe bleeding requiring multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma during and after surgeries."
33136043,Osteonecrosis of the jaw as a late complication of herpes zoster infection: a case report.,"Occurrences of rare oral complications following herpes zoster (HZ) infection have been reported. In the present case, a 57-year-old man was referred for periodontal evaluation due to gingival bleeding. His medical history included diagnoses of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and HZ infection. Intraoral examination revealed necrosis and alveolar bone exposure around the mandibular left lateral incisor, and the patient reported spontaneous exfoliation of the maxillary and mandibular left central incisors. Conservative surgical and antibiotic therapies were provided to the patient, and a diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw following HZ infection was established. There were no signs of recurrence in 17 months of follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of unusual complications related to a previous HZ infection."
33025463,"The Complex Management of Atrial Fibrillation and Cancer in the COVID-19 Era: Drug Interactions, Thromboembolic Risk, and Proarrhythmia.","Cardiotoxicity by anticancer agents has emerged as a multifaceted issue and is expected to affect both mortality and morbidity. This review summarizes clinical challenges in the management of oncological patients requiring anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (AF) also considering the current outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, since this infection can add challenges to the management of both conditions. Specifically, the aims are manyfold: (1) describe the evolving use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in AF patients with cancer; (2) critically appraise the risk of clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between DOACs and oral targeted anticancer agents; (3) address expected DDIs between DOACs and candidate anti-COVID drugs, with implications on management of the underlying thrombotic risk; and (4) characterize the proarrhythmic liability in cardio-oncology in the setting of COVID-19, focusing on QT prolongation.
AF in cardio-oncology poses diagnostic and management challenges, also due to the number of anticancer drugs recently associated with AF onset/worsening. Oral targeted drugs can potentially interact with DOACs, with increased bleeding risk mainly due to pharmacokinetic DDIs. Moreover, the vast majority of oral anticancer agents cause QT prolongation with direct and indirect mechanisms, potentially resulting in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, especially in susceptible patients with COVID-19 receiving additional drugs with QT liability. Oncologists and cardiologists must be aware of the increased bleeding risk and arrhythmic susceptibility of patients with AF and cancer due to DDIs. High-risk individuals with COVID-19 should be prioritized to target preventive strategies, including optimal antithrombotic management, medication review, and stringent monitoring."
32998537,Spontaneous Regression of a Large Nasal Hemangioma in a 55-Year-Old Male.,"Lobular capillary hemangiomas (LCHs) are benign vascular lesions of the skin, oral cavity, and, rarely, the nasal cavity that are histologically characterized by capillary proliferation and a lobular architecture. The etiology of LCH is not well understood, but the possible underlying factors include trauma, hormonal influences, and angiogenic growth factors. This case report describes the spontaneous complete regression of an LCH without further surgery although it was incompletely excised. To our knowledge, this is a rare case for a middle-aged man."
32942757,A Review of the Incidence Diagnosis and Treatment of Spontaneous Hemorrhage in Patients Treated with Direct Oral Anticoagulants.,"Anticoagulation carries a tremendous therapeutic advantage in reducing morbidity and mortality with venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation. For over six decades, traditional anticoagulants like low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists like warfarin have been used to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. In the past decade, multiple new direct oral anticoagulants have emerged and been approved for clinical use. Since their introduction, direct oral anticoagulants have changed the landscape of anticoagulants. With increasing indications and use in various patients, they have become the mainstay of treatment in venous thromboembolic diseases. The safety profile of direct oral anticoagulants is better or at least similar to warfarin, but several recent reports are focusing on spontaneous hemorrhages with direct oral anticoagulants. This narrative review aims to summarize the incidence of spontaneous hemorrhage in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants and also offers practical management strategies for clinicians when patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants present with bleeding complications."
32917401,[Haemorrhagic complications following ibrutinib intake after dermatological surgery].,"Ibrutinib is a selective oral inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. It is used in haematology to treat lymphoid B disorders. Haemorrhagic complications in dermatological surgery are occasionally associated with the use of anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant medication. Herein, we report a case of haemorrhage under ibrutinib following skin surgery.
A 70-year-old male patient began treatment with ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had 2 basal cell carcinomas of the face. The next day he had a persistent haemorrhage lasting more than 48h, with no effects on the final scarring result.
Ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor whose mechanism of action plays a role in platelet adhesion. It is known to cause haemorrhaging, either spontaneously or following invasive procedures, especially at the beginning of treatment. In the case of low-risk haemorrhagic procedures in which bleeding may be controlled by mechanical haemostasis, ibrutinib should be discontinued 3 days before and after surgery. In the event of recent initiation of ibrutinib and in the absence of urgent dermatological management, it is preferable to schedule any surgical procedures 3 months after the start of ibrutinib."
32908712,Anesthetic Management for Emergent Repair of Tracheoinnominate Fistula.,"We present a case of a 30-year-old female, who had tracheostomy revision complicated by false passage into the subcutaneous space and pneumothorax. Six days later, she developed massive bleeding from the mouth, nose, and tracheostomy site. Approximately 2 liters of blood was lost. With high suspicion for tracheo-innominate fistula, she was emergently brought to the operating room for fistula repair. Her anesthetic management was initially focused on maintaining spontaneous ventilation with inhalation agents until surgical exposure was adequate. An endotracheal tube was then placed under guidance of a video-laryngoscope. The tracheostomy tube was then removed over a Cook catheter to maintain secure passage in case of airway collapse. The oral endotracheal tube was then inserted distal to the arterial and tracheal defect. The patient's bleeding was stopped, the fistula was repaired, and she was transferred back to the intensive care unit, but she died several days later due to multi-organ failure."
32853559,"Mifepristone and misoprostol versus misoprostol alone for the management of missed miscarriage (MifeMiso): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","The anti-progesterone drug mifepristone and the prostaglandin misoprostol can be used to treat missed miscarriage. However, it is unclear whether a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective than administering misoprostol alone. We investigated whether treatment with mifepristone plus misoprostol would result in a higher rate of completion of missed miscarriage compared with misoprostol alone.
MifeMiso was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in 28 UK hospitals. Women were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 16 years and older, diagnosed with a missed miscarriage by pelvic ultrasound scan in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, chose to have medical management of miscarriage, and were willing and able to give informed consent. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a single dose of oral mifepristone 200 mg or an oral placebo tablet, both followed by a single dose of vaginal, oral, or sublingual misoprostol 800 μg 2 days later. Randomisation was managed via a secure web-based randomisation program, with minimisation to balance study group assignments according to maternal age (<30 years vs ≥30 years), body-mass index (<35 kg/m
Between Oct 3, 2017, and July 22, 2019, 2595 women were identified as being eligible for the MifeMiso trial. 711 women were randomly assigned to receive either mifepristone and misoprostol (357 women) or placebo and misoprostol (354 women). 696 (98%) of 711 women had available data for the primary outcome. 59 (17%) of 348 women in the mifepristone plus misoprostol group did not pass the gestational sac spontaneously within 7 days versus 82 (24%) of 348 women in the placebo plus misoprostol group (risk ratio [RR] 0·73, 95% CI 0·54-0·99; p=0·043). 62 (17%) of 355 women in the mifepristone plus misoprostol group required surgical intervention to complete the miscarriage versus 87 (25%) of 353 women in the placebo plus misoprostol group (0·71, 0·53-0·95; p=0·021). We found no difference in incidence of adverse events between the study groups.
Treatment with mifepristone plus misoprostol was more effective than misoprostol alone in the management of missed miscarriage. Women with missed miscarriage should be offered mifepristone pretreatment before misoprostol to increase the chance of successful miscarriage management, while reducing the need for miscarriage surgery.

The study is designed as a multi-centre, interventional, parallel group, superiority, randomized, investigator sponsored, three arms study. Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups in a ratio 1:1:1.
Inpatients will be recruited from 8 Italian Academic and non-Academic Intensive Care Units INCLUSION CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED): 1. Positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic (on pharyngeal swab of deep airways material) 2. Positive pressure ventilation (either non-invasive or invasive) from > 24 hours 3. Invasive mechanical ventilation from < 96 hours 4. PaO
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at day 28 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: - Ventilation free days (VFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days that patient is alive and free of ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) between randomization and day 28 (censored at hospital discharge). - Need of rescue administration of high-dose steroids or immune-modulatory drugs; - Occurrence of switch from non-invasive to invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay; - Delay from start of non-invasive ventilation to switch to invasive ventilation; - All-cause mortality at ICU discharge and hospital discharge; - ICU free days (IFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days between ICU discharge and day 28. - Occurrence of new infections from randomization to day 28; including infections by Candida, Aspergillus, Adenovirus, Herpes Virus e Cytomegalovirus - Occurrence of new organ dysfunction and grade of dysfunction during ICU stay. - Objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction; Safety endpoints: - Occurrence of major bleeding, defined as transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells in a day, bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal], bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention and bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); - Occurrence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, defined ad acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of any bleeding compromising hemodynamic; spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm
A block randomisation will be used with variable block sizes (block size 4-6-8), stratified by 3 factors: Centre, BMI (<30/≥30) and Age (<75/≥75). Central randomisation will be performed using a secure, web-based, randomisation system with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician using computer generated random numbers.
Participants to the study will be blinded to group assignment.
The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that the combined use of UHF and steroid versus the LMWH group will significantly reduce the risk of death at day 28. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 210 with a randomization 1:1:1 and seventy patients in each group. Assuming an alpha of 2.5% (two tailed) and mortality rate in LMWH group of 50%, as indicated from initial studies of ICU patients, the study will have an 80% power to detect at least a 25 % absolute reduction in the risk of death between: a) LMHW + steroid group and LMWH group or b) UHF + steroid group and LMWH group. The study has not been sized to assess the difference between LMHW + steroid group and UHF + steroid group, therefore the results obtained from this comparison will need to be interpreted with caution and will need further adequately sized studies confirm the effect. On the basis of a conservative estimation, that 8 participating sites admit an average of 3 eligible patients per month per centre (24 patients/month). Assuming that 80 % of eligible patients are enrolled, recruitment of 210 participants will be completed in approximately 10 months.

32474206,"The INVICTUS rheumatic heart disease research program: Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a randomized trial of rivaroxaban compared to vitamin K antagonists in rheumatic valvular disease and atrial fibrillation.","Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a neglected disease affecting 33 million people, mainly in low and middle income countries. Yet very few large trials or registries have been conducted in this population. The INVICTUS program of research in RHD consists of a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of 4500 patients comparing rivaroxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with RHD and atrial fibrillation (AF), a registry of 17,000 patients to document the contemporary clinical course of patients with RHD, including a focused sub-study on pregnant women with RHD within the registry. This paper describes the rationale, design, organization and baseline characteristics of the RCT and a summary of the design of the registry and its sub-study. Patients with RHD and AF are considered to be at high risk of embolic strokes, and oral anticoagulation with VKAs is recommended for stroke prevention. But the quality of anticoagulation with VKA is poor in developing countries. A drug which does not require monitoring, and which is safe and effective for preventing stroke in patients with valvular AF, would fulfill a major unmet need.
The INVestIgation of rheumatiC AF Treatment Using VKAs, rivaroxaban or aspirin Studies (INVICTUS-VKA) trial is an international, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, testing whether rivaroxaban 20 mg given once daily is non-inferior (or superior) to VKA in patients with RHD, AF, and an elevated risk of stroke (mitral stenosis with valve area ≤2 cm
INVICTUS is the largest program of clinical research focused on a neglected cardiovascular disease and will provide new information on the clinical course of patients with RHD, and approaches to anticoagulation in those with concomitant AF."
32468316,Emergency surgery is an effective way to improve the outcome of severe spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients on long-term oral antiplatelet therapy.,"The necessity of emergency surgery for severe spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SSICH) patients on long-term oral antiplatelet therapy (LOAPT) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and safety of emergency surgery for SSICH patients on LOAPT (SSICH-LOAPT patients). In this study, a retrospective review of patients admitted to our institution for SSICH from January 2012 to December 2018 was conducted. The collected data included demographic, clinical, and surgical information. The outcome was recorded at 3 months after primary hemorrhage. The outcome of SSICH-LOAPT patients receiving emergency surgery and conservative treatment were compared. The risk of postoperative intracranial bleeding (PIB) in operated SSICH-LOAPT patients was further investigated. A total of 522 SSICH patients were retrospectively reviewed, including 181 SSICH-LOAPT patients and 269 operated patients. The total mortality and in-hospital mortality were 40.6% and 19.3%, respectively. As compared with SSICH-LOAPT patients receiving conservative treatment, the operated SSICH-LOAPT patients showed a lower total (p = 0.043) and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.024). When compared with operated patients not on LOAPT, the operated patients on LOAPT exhibited a higher rate of PIB (OR, 2.34; 95% CI 1.14-4.79; p = 0.018). As demonstrated by the multivariate logistic analysis, dual antiplatelet therapy were independent risk factors associated with PIB in operated SSICH-LOAPT patients (OR, 3.42; CI, 1.01-11.51; p = 0.047). Despite of increasing risk of PIB, emergency surgery could improve the outcome of SSICH-LOAPT patients as it could be effective in reducing mortality. Dual antiplatelet therapy was the independent risk factor related to the PIB in operated SSICH-LOAPT patients."
32371687,Facial Nerve Palsy Associated With Orthognathic Surgery.,"The authors report a 25-year-old female who presented facial palsy after undergoing bimaxillary orthognathic surgery for retrognathism correction. Orthognathic surgery is a procedure used to treat dentofacial deformities which aims to achieve an adequate relationship between dental archs, improving function (such as chewing, breathing, and speaking) and facial aesthetics. Even though there are some complications that can occur during the intraoperative and postoperative periods like bleeding, tooth, soft-tissue damage, nerve damage, bad split, infection, and nonunion, facial nerve injuries are considered rare complications after this kind of surgical procedure. Despite being uncommon, rarely described, transient, and spontaneously resolved in almost all patients, facial nerve palsy is one of the most serious complications because it directly affects patient's quality of life and social interaction."
32351744,Spontaneous Spinal Epidural Hematoma in a Patient on Apixaban for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.,"With the rise in the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), more hemorrhagic complications are being encountered. Since the first description of a case of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) related to the utilization of DOACs in 2012, there have been few reports describing a similar association. However, no cases so far have reported an association between SSEHs and apixaban. 
Spinal hematomas represent surgical emergencies with earlier intervention portending better outcome. Based on the few case reports that point to DOACs as a potential culprit, it appears that a high suspicion index resulting in earlier SSEH diagnosis and intervention is crucial for improved neurological outcome and recovery. Prompt diagnosis remains a challenge, especially that SSEH can mimic cerebrovascular accidents."
32351686,Spontaneous rupture and hematoma of the sartorius muscle secondary to rivaroxaban therapy.,"Spontaneous muscular hematomas are quite rare as they occur mush less frequently than intracranial hematomas and gastrointestinal bleeding in patients under oral anticoagulant therapy. Coumarins, such as warfarin or acitrom, are the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulants agents and have been associated more with the development of hematomas than direct factor X inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban [ 1]. Few reports have linked oral anticoagulation therapy with the development of muscular hematomas; however, clinical cases regarding the involvement of the sartorius muscle remain limited. Patients with advanced age, under oral anticoagulant therapy with pain and ecchymosis in the thigh region, should undergo radiological evaluation utilizing ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to establish an accurate diagnosis. The following case consists of a patient that while resting presented with a spontaneous rupture and hematoma of the sartorius muscle secondary to rivaroxaban use. During follow-up, the patient recovered completely."
32327246,Spontaneous intramural hematoma of the alimentary canal.,"Spontaneous intramural hematoma of the alimentary canal has rarely been reported. We present two cases in which anticoagulation therapy brings spontaneous intramural hematoma of the alimentary canal. In one case, the lesion was located in the ileum, and the other was located in the ascending colon and distal ileum. Both patients were cured through conservative treatment. We suggest that increased attention should be paid if a patient has acute abdominal pain with a history of oral anticoagulant therapy, and the diagnosis of spontaneous intermural hematoma should be considered."

32290209,Prognostic Value of Non-Contrast CT Markers and Spot Sign for Outcome Prediction in Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage under Oral Anticoagulation.,"In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), several non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers and the spot sign (SS) in computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) have been established for the prediction of hematoma growth and neurological outcome. However, the prognostic value of these markers in patients under oral anticoagulation (ORAC) is unclear. We hypothesized that outcome prediction by these imaging markers may be significantly different between patients with and without ORAC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of NCCT markers and SS in patients with ICH under ORAC.
This is a retrospective study of the database for patients with ICH at a German tertiary stroke center. Inclusion criteria were (1) patients with ICH, (2) oral anticoagulation within the therapeutic range, and (3) NCCT and CTA performed on admission within 6 h after onset of symptoms. We defined a binary outcome: modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3 = good outcome versus mRS > 3 = poor outcome at discharge. The predictive value of each sign was assessed in uni- and multivariable logistic regression models.
Of 129 patients with ICH under ORAC, 76 (58.9%) presented with hypodensities within the hematoma in admission NCCT, 64 (52.7%) presented with an irregular shape of the hematoma, 60 (46.5%) presented with a swirl sign, 49 (38.0%) presented with a black hole sign, and 46 (35.7%) presented with a heterogeneous density of the hematoma. Moreover, 44 (34.1%) patients had a satellite sign, in 20 (15.5%) patients, an island sign was detected, 18 (14.0%) patients were blend-sign positive, and 14 (10.9%) patients presented with a CTA spot sign. Inter-rater agreement was very high for all included characteristics between the two readers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the presence of black hole sign (odds ratio 10.59; 
The distribution and prognostic value of several NCCT markers and CTA spot sign in ICH patients under ORAC is comparable to those with spontaneous ICH, even though these parameters are partly based on coagulant status. These findings suggest that a similar approach can be used for further research regarding outcome prediction in ICH patients under ORAC and those with spontaneous ICH."

32277739,Severe Necrotizing Periodontitis in an HIV-Infected Patient: Case Report and Non-Surgical Treatment.,"Necrotizing periodontitis (NP) is an atypical and painful form of periodontal disease, it is described by a promptly progress of ulceration and destruction of periodontal tissues; the NP is commonly linked to HIV-positive patients. The aim of this report is to present a rare case of severe necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis treated non-surgically.
A 28-year-old dark skin female patient was referred to a dentistry college with the main complaint of spontaneous gingival bleeding and enlargement, oral pain during deglutition and dental hypersensitivity. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed generalized severe periodontal destruction, extensive bleeding, increased biofilm presence and spontaneous suppuration. Medical exams were requested, red and white blood cells were evaluated and among those exams an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 antibodies, the result reveled reagent to HIV-1. The diagnosis of NP was assigned based on periodontal parameters such as necrosis and ulceration of the coronal portion of interdental papillae and gingival margin. Treatment established was scaling and root planning plus antibiotics. At 3 months of treatment the clinical and periodontal condition were stable.
This case report highlights a severe and generalized form of NP, where periodontal non-surgical associated with antimicrobials resulted in elimination of the gingival enlargement, necrosis and ulceration of the coronal portion of interdental papillae and significant improvement of periodontal parameters."
32270448,Contrast medium-induced severe thrombocytopenia in patient on maintenance hemodialysis: a case report and literature review.,"A 43-year-old male patient on maintenance hemodialysis had an enhanced computed tomography scan examination with iohexol for the first time 10 min before regular hemodialysis therapy. At the start of hemodialysis, no symptoms were observed, and the platelet count was 148,000/μl. Approximately 1 h after starting hemodialysis, dyspnea and chest discomfort appeared. Since oxygen saturation of the peripheral artery decreased to 87%, oxygen administration was immediately started while continuing hemodialysis therapy. Furthermore, gingival hemorrhage was observed, and the platelet count decreased to 5000/μl. We were carefully monitoring his conditions while continuing hemodialysis and oxygen administration, but no further deterioration was observed. Thereafter, these symptoms and severe thrombocytopenia gradually improved without additional treatment. At the end of hemodialysis, these symptoms completely disappeared. As well, the platelet count recovered to 35,000/μl at the end of hemodialysis and increased to 92,000/μl the next morning. From the clinical course, we diagnosed with contrast medium-induced thrombocytopenia. Acute thrombocytopenia is a rare complication induced by the contrast medium. Until now, 16 cases on contrast medium-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported. Our case spontaneously recovered from severe thrombocytopenia relatively earlier than previous reports. Our patient started hemodialysis therapy 10 min after an enhanced computed tomography examination. Early removal of contrast medium by hemodialysis might be associated with early improvement. We should acknowledge that contrast media have potential to induce severe thrombocytopenia, even in patients on maintenance hemodialysis."

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics, the incidence of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus and its predictors, and spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) in a population of patients with AF depending on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values.
This study included 1962 patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiographic examination prior to cardioversion or ablation in the years 2014-2018 in three cardiac centers.
More than a quarter of AF patients had decreased eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and were characterized as a high-risk population, with more comorbidities, higher thromboembolic and bleeding risk compared to those with normal renal function. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) was prescribed in 97% and 93% of patients with decreased and normal eGFR, respectively, with a higher prevalence of prescribed non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The incidence of LAA thrombus (24%, 9% and 4%) and SEC (25%, 25% and 19%) increases simultaneously with a decrease in eGFR (< 30, 30-59 and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). Among patients prescribed reduced doses of NOAC, those with decreased eGFR were more often observed with LAA thrombus (10% vs. 2.5%). Non-paroxysmal AF, heart failure and previous bleeding were predictors of LAA thrombus, irrespective of eGFR value. CKD was the predictor of LAA thrombus in all patients including those with non-paroxysmal AF, males, without diabetes, without hypertension and with CHA2DS2-VASc < 2.
Despite OAC, patients with concomitant AF and CKD remain at high risk for LAA thrombus formation."
32023350,Spontaneous bilateral haemothorax with haemopericardium secondary to rivaroxaban.,"Although the risk of major bleeding with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is low, life-threatening bleeding can occur.
We report a case of an 81-year-old female with deep vein thrombosis who developed bilateral spontaneous haemothorax and haemopericardium after rivaroxaban therapy. Diagnostic thoracentesis revealed a grossly bloody pleural effusion. She was treated with factor eight inhibitor bypassing agent, but the result was not satisfactory.
To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a concomitant presentation of spontaneous bilateral haemothorax and haemopericardium due to rivaroxaban use. This case highlights the potential risk of major haemorrhagic complication of NOAC, which could be life-threatening and require emergent reversal."
32014375,"The safety of oral anticoagulants registry (SOAR): A national, ED-based study of the evaluation and management of bleeding and bleeding concerns due to the use of oral anticoagulants.","The Safety of Oral Anticoagulants Registry (SOAR) was designed to describe the evaluation and management of patients with oral anticoagulant (OAC)-related major bleeding or bleeding concerns who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute illness or injury. Patients in the ED are increasingly taking anticoagulants, which can cause bleeding-related complications as well as impact the acute management of related or unrelated clinical issues that prompt presentation. Modifications of emergency evaluation and management due to anticoagulation have not previously been studied.
This was a multicenter observational in-hospital study of patients who were judged to be experiencing an active OAC effect and had (a) an obvious bleeding event or (b) were deemed at risk for serious bleeding spontaneously, after injury, or during an indicated invasive procedure. Diagnostic testing, therapies employed, and clinical outcomes were collected.
Thirty-one US hospitals contributed data to SOAR. Of 1513 subjects, acute hemorrhage (AH) qualified 78%, while 22% had a bleeding concern (BC). Warfarin was the index OAC in 37.3%, dabigatran in 13.3%, and an anti-Factor X
Care of anticoagulated patients in the acute care setting is inconsistent, reflecting the diversity of presentation. As the prevalence of OAC use increases with the aging of the US population, further study and targeted educational efforts are needed to drive more evidence-based care of these patients."
31945588,A systematic review on the effects of direct oral anticoagulants on cancer growth and metastasis in animal models.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now the first choice thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients who do not have a high risk of bleeding. In addition to the anticoagulant effects, potential anti-tumor effects of DOACs have also been studied in animal cancer models. In this study, we summarize the effects of DOACs on cancer growth and metastasis in animal models through a systematic review with a qualitative analysis.
PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were systematically searched for original studies that describe animal models of cancer in which one of the experimental groups received DOAC monotherapy, and which reported quantitatively on primary tumor or metastases.
Nine studies - reporting a total of 19 animal experiments - met the inclusion criteria. These 19 experiments included spontaneous cancer (n = 2), carcinogenicity (n = 2), xenograft (n = 7) and syngeneic (n = 8) models, encompassing orthotopic (n = 7), subcutaneous (n = 5), intraperitoneal (n = 1) and intravenous (n = 2) injection of cancer cells and included treatments with the DOACs ximelagatran (n = 4), dabigatran etexilate (n = 6) and/or rivaroxaban (n = 11). DOAC treatment decreased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 18.8% (3/16) and 20.0% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively. Conversely, DOACs increased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 6.3% (1/16) and 20.0% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively.
DOAC monotherapy resulted in neoplastic changes in a rat carcinogenicity study, showed a lack of effect in mouse xenograft models, while the effect on cancer growth and metastasis in mouse syngeneic models depended on the timing of DOAC treatment and type of cancer model used."
31862517,The prognostic utility of ICH-score in anticoagulant related intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Although intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) score is used to provide an estimate on the probability of mortality following spontaneous ICH of any cause, its utility has not been exclusively tested in ICH patients with history of treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The aim of the present report is to investigate the utility of ICH score for mortality prognostication of VKA-ICH and NOAC-ICH patients. We used receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to estimate the accuracy parameters for the different values of ICH score in the prognosis of mortality within 30-days after the onset of NOAC-ICH or VKA-ICH. We analyzed data from 108 NOAC-ICH and 241 VKA-ICH patients (median age 76 years, 58% males, median NIHSS score 11 points, median ICH-score 2 points). ICH score of 4 points was uncovered to be the most favorable threshold for the prediction of 30-day mortality both after NOAC-ICH (sensitivity: 57.7%, specificity: 98.8%) or VKA-ICH (sensitivity: 42.1%, specificity: 92.6%). However, comparison of the areas under the curve (AUC) suggested a cumulatively higher (p = .001) predictive value of ICH-score in the prognostication of 30-day mortality after ICH related to the use of NOACs (AUC: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.86-0.98) compared to the ICH related to the use of VKAs (AUC: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.70-0.83). In conclusion, ICH score seems to have an adequate predictive utility in the prognostication of 30-day mortality following an ICH related to the use of oral anticoagulants, with better yield in ICH cases associated with the use of NOACs."
31813363,Oral Anticoagulation in Asian Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and a History of Intracranial Hemorrhage.,"Background and Purpose- Warfarin is associated with a better net clinical benefit compared with no treatment in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). There are limited data on nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in these patients, especially in the Asian population. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of NOACs to warfarin in a large-scale nationwide Asian population with AF and a history of ICH. Methods- Using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database from January 2010 to April 2018, we identified patients with oral anticoagulant naïve nonvalvular AF with a prior spontaneous ICH. For the comparisons, warfarin and NOAC groups were balanced using propensity score weighting. Ischemic stroke, ICH, composite outcome (ischemic stroke+ICH), fatal ischemic stroke, fatal ICH, death from composite outcome, and all-cause death were evaluated as clinical outcomes. Results- Among 5712 patients with AF with prior ICH, 2434 were treated with warfarin and 3278 were treated with NOAC. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced after propensity score weighting (mean age 72.5 years and CHA"
31713696,Idiopathic spontaneous sublingual hematoma: a case report and literature review.,"Sublingual hematoma is a rare complication seen in bleeding disorders, trauma, dental procedures, and the use of anticoagulants. Only a few publications have described idiopathic spontaneous sublingual hematoma, and all of them suspected severe hypertension as etiology. Our objective is to present a case of idiopathic spontaneous sublingual hematoma in a 48-year-old patient without any medical history of hypertension and to perform a literature review on this subject.
Case report presentation based on information extracted from the electronic patient database of Ghent University Hospital including a literature review of sublingual hematoma.
This case report describes a 48-year-old male patient presenting with a spontaneous sublingual hematoma, which needed to be treated with an urgent tracheotomy. Drainage of the old hematoma followed 11 days later. He was not known with hypertension or any bleeding disorder. Clinical examination using fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, a CT scan, MRI scan, and biopsy of the sublingual salivary gland showed no focus for etiology.
Clinical work-up is necessary to look for a cause of a spontaneous sublingual hematoma. Idiopathic spontaneous hematoma is only a rare entity. Aggressive airway management should be the first step in treatment. To date, there is no consensus about the management regarding the hematoma itself. Mostly, clinicians start with observation for spontaneous resolution of the hematoma and when possible to treat causative factors. Surgical drainage is performed when conservative treatment is not sufficient."
31711921,Efficacy and Safety of Etrasimod in a Phase 2 Randomized Trial of Patients With Ulcerative Colitis.,"Etrasimod (APD334) is an oral, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator in development for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. We assessed the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).
In a phase 2, proof-of-concept, double-blind, parallel-group study, adult outpatients with modified Mayo Clinic scores (MCSs) (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopy findings) of 4-9, endoscopic subscores of 2 or more, and rectal bleeding subscores of 1 or more were randomly assigned to groups given once-daily etrasimod 1 mg (n = 52), etrasimod 2 mg (n = 50), or placebo (n = 54) for 12 weeks. The study was performed from October 15, 2015, through February 14, 2018, at 87 centers in 17 countries. The primary endpoint was an increase in the mean improvement in modified MCS from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with endoscopic improvement (subscores of 1 or less) from baseline to week 12. Exploratory endpoints, including clinical remission, are reported in the article, although the study was statistically powered to draw conclusions only on the primary endpoint.
At week 12, the etrasimod 2 mg group met the primary and all secondary endpoints. Etrasimod 2 mg led to a significantly greater increase in mean improvement in modified MCS from baseline than placebo (difference from placebo, 0.99 points; 90% confidence interval, 0.30-1.68; P = .009), and etrasimod 1 mg led to an increase in mean improvement from baseline in modified MCS of 0.43 points more than placebo (90% confidence interval, reduction of 0.24 to increase of 1.11; nominal P = .15). Endoscopic improvement occurred in 41.8% of patients receiving etrasimod 2 mg vs 17.8% receiving placebo (P = .003). Most adverse events were mild to moderate. Three patients had a transient, asymptomatic, low-grade atrioventricular block that resolved spontaneously all patients had evidence of atrioventricular block before etrasimod exposure.
In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, etrasimod 2 mg was more effective than placebo in producing clinical and endoscopic improvements. Further clinical development is warranted. Clinicaltrials.gov, Number: NCT02447302."
31624430,Complications of Diagnostic TMJ Arthroscopy: An Institutional Study.,"The prevalence of using arthroscopy for the diagnosis of the TMJ disorders is increasing due to its superiority to conventional methods of imaging. Although considered to be safe, complications do occur.
A single operator single-institution retrospective study consisting of 50 patients taken up for diagnostic arthroscopy was analysed for complications.
Lacerations of external acoustic meatus was found in 03 patients (6%); immediate partial hearing loss was seen in 01 patient (2%); transient facial nerve palsy was found in 05 patients (10%); sensory disturbances over the distribution of auriculotemporal nerve was evident in 01 patient (2%); haemorrhage as visualised by excessive bleeding through trocar skin puncture wound was seen in 05 patients (5%). Post-operative pain more than the pre-operative pain on assessment by visual analogue scale was noted in 05 patients (10%) on the immediate post-operative day. Reduction in spontaneous mouth opening was noted in 15 patients (30%).
Though the complication rate was found to be higher than most of the other studies, they were minor which resolved without any intervention. The cases with complications were clustered at the beginning of the series which suggests the steep learning curve and the importance of surgeons' experience and skill involved in this procedure."
31588196,Adverse reaction profiles of hemorrhagic adverse reactions caused by direct oral anticoagulants analyzed using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are used in anticoagulant therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of DOAC-induced gastrointestinal (GI) and nervous system hemorrhage using the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. We identified and analyzed the reports of hemorrhagic reactions between 2004 and 2016 from the FAERS and JADER databases, and calculated the adjusted reported odds ratio (ROR) using the multiple logistic regression method. Additionally, we used the time-to-onset analysis. In the FAERS database, the adjusted ROR of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran for GI hemorrhage was 6.79 (5.84-7.91), 19.58 (18.85-20.34), and 14.51 (13.58-15.51), respectively. In the JADER database, the adjusted ROR of apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran for GI hemorrhage was 11.80 (9.50-14.64), 11.03 (9.18-13.26), 10.17 (6.95-14.88), and 9.85 (7.23-13.42), respectively. We found that the association of GI hemorrhage with DOACs was affected by sex (female). Additionally, 30% of GI hemorrhage was observed after 30 days. Hemorrhagic reactions of both GI and nervous systems were observed in both the spontaneous reporting system databases. We recommend that female patients who experience symptoms related to GI hemorrhage should be closely monitored and advised to adhere to an appropriate care plan. Additionally, our results show that patients should be closely monitored for hemorrhage even after a month."
31443074,A grading scale for surgically treated patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage: the Surgical Swedish ICH Score.,"The authors aimed to develop the first clinical grading scale for patients with surgically treated spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
A nationwide multicenter study including 401 ICH patients surgically treated by craniotomy and evacuation of a spontaneous supratentorial ICH was conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015. All neurosurgical centers in Sweden were included. All medical records and neuroimaging studies were retrospectively reviewed. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk stratification scale (the Surgical Swedish ICH [SwICH] Score) was developed using weighting of independent predictors based on strength of association.
Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (p = 0.00015), ICH volume ≥ 50 mL (p = 0.031), patient age ≥ 75 years (p = 0.0056), prior myocardial infarction (MI) (p = 0.00081), and type 2 diabetes (p = 0.0093). The Surgical SwICH Score was the sum of individual points assigned as follows: GCS score 15-13 (0 points), 12-5 (1 point), 4-3 (2 points); age ≥ 75 years (1 point); ICH volume ≥ 50 mL (1 point); type 2 diabetes (1 point); prior MI (1 point). Each increase in the Surgical SwICH Score was associated with a progressively increased 30-day mortality (p = 0.0002). No patient with a Surgical SwICH Score of 0 died, whereas the 30-day mortality rates for patients with Surgical SwICH Scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 5%, 12%, 31%, and 58%, respectively.
The Surgical SwICH Score is a predictor of 30-day mortality in patients treated surgically for spontaneous supratentorial ICH. External validation is needed to assess the predictive value as well as the generalizability of the Surgical SwICH Score."
31375404,Intracerebral Hemorrhage in a Young Urban Population: Etiologies and Outcomes in Patients 50 and Younger.,"There is limited research on intracerebral hemorrhage in young urban populations. There is reduced access to healthcare and a high prevalence of multiple comorbidities in this vulnerable population. We studied the etiologies and outcomes of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in an urban North Philadelphia cohort aged 50 years old and younger.
A retrospective chart review of subjects 50 years old and younger who presented with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage at Temple University Hospital was conducted. A novel scoring system was used to classify the cause of each intracerebral hemorrhage. This system was used to assign a degree of likelihood that hypertension, amyloid angiopathy, tumor, oral anticoagulants, vascular malformations, infrequent causes, or cryptogenic etiologies were present. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage was excluded. The prevalence of each risk factor and outcomes were analyzed.
Of the 110 patients in the study, the most common etiology was hypertension (82.7%). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between patients with multiple possible etiologies for their hemorrhage. Vascular malformations and cavernomas were rare (5.5%).
Hypertension was the most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage in a young urban population. The presence of multiple possible etiologies does not correlate with a worse prognosis of mortality. There is a need for further research into hemorrhagic stroke in young populations."
31375402,Resumption of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Acute Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Decisions regarding whether and when to resume direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are challenging. We examined the timing of DOAC resumption and factors that influence decision-making in DOAC resumption.
We retrospectively analyzed 43 patients with ICH who were treated with DOAC for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation before ICH onset. All patients were divided into 2 groups (resumption of DOAC and no resumption of DOAC) during hospitalization. Clinical backgrounds, laboratory data, and stroke severity were compared between the groups.
DOAC were resumed in 19 of 39 (49%) acute ICH survivors and were not resumed in 24 patients, including 4 deceased patients. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission tended to be higher in the no resumption group (median, 17) than in the resumption group (median, 6) (P = .119). The modified Rankin Scale score was slightly poorer in the no resumption group (median, 4) than in the resumption group (median, 3) (P = .070). In the resumption group, DOAC were resumed at a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 5-21 days) after ICH onset. The modified Rankin Scale score at discharge was positively correlated with the days of DOAC resumption (R
In half of patients, DOAC were resumed relatively early after ICH onset. Early resumption of DOAC for ICH in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is considered to be safe. The functional outcome was associated with not only resumption of DOAC but also the timing of resumption."
31288831,Glibenclamide in aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (GASH): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Recent findings on the benefits of glibenclamide as a neuroprotective drug have started a new era for prospective studies on sulfonylureas. The effect of glibenclamide blocking the Sur1-Trpm4 channel was examined in models of subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke, with findings of significantly reduced tight-junction abnormalities, resulting in less edema formation and considerably reduced transsynaptic apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and significantly ameliorated impairments in spatial learning. Based on these data, we plan a clinical trial to establish evidence of glibenclamide as an adjunct treatment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
An estimated 80 patients meeting the inclusion criteria of radiological confirmatory evidence of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, age 18-70 years, and presentation of less than 96 h from the ictus will be allocated randomly into two groups, one receiving 5 mg daily oral intake of glibenclamide for 21 days and another control group receiving a placebo. The study's primary outcome is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) after 6 months, as favorable (mRS 0-2) or unfavorable (mRS 3-6). The secondary outcomes will be late cognitive status, assessed after 6 months by psychological tests (the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment), as well as death at 6 months, delayed cerebral ischemia and occurrence of serious adverse events due to study medication.
There is a growing interest in the scientific community regarding glibenclamide in brain edema and traumatic brain injury, but with very little of this interest targeting spontaneous brain hemorrhage, especially aneurism rupture. Positive outcomes are expected for the treatment patients, especially in language and memory preservation, as has been shown in experimental models.

31263649,Sudden Loss of Vision: An Insight into Rivaroxaban.,"A retrobulbar hemorrhage is a rapidly worsening emergent condition characteristically associated with significant orbital or facial trauma. Spontaneous hemorrhage into the retrobulbar compartment is rare. If not managed in a timely manner, it can lead to permanent vision loss. Rivaroxaban is a directly acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits factor Xa and is widely used for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib)."
31169827,[Contemporary approaches to determine the duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism].,"The review is devoted to the issue of optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolic complications (VTEC) using oral anticoagulants (OAC). These drugs are characterized by higher safety in comparison with vitamin K antagonists and make it possible to increase the duration of treatment for not only spontaneous thrombosis (with high risk of recurrence), but also thrombosis provoked by minor persistent and transient risk factors of VTEC. Efficacy and safety of prolonged treatment of VTEC using OAC was analyzed. Different classifications of primary thrombotic episode depending on risk of subsequent recurrence are presented. Moreover, scales for individual assessment of risk of recurrent thrombosis after anticoagulant therapy cancellation and risk of bleeding in case of continued treatment are given. Outcomes of long-term administration of rivaroxaban for VTEC are analyzed. It was concluded that OAC are safe for prolonged management of primary thrombotic episode. However, overall duration of treatment should be determined considering individual balance of benefits and risks.
Статья представляет собой классический обзор литературы, посвященный вопросам определения оптимальной длительности антикоагулянтной терапии венозных тромбоэмболических осложнений (ВТЭО) в свете широкого внедрения прямых оральных антикоагулянтов (ПОАК). Последние, обладая в сравнении с антагонистами витамина K улучшенным профилем безопасности, позволяют увеличивать длительность лечения не только клинически неспровоцированных тромбозов (наиболее опасных в отношении рецидива), но и спровоцированных малыми персистирующими и транзиторными факторами риска ВТЭО, характеризующихся меньшей угрозой. Проведен анализ результатов исследований по изучению эффективности и безопасности продленной терапии ВТЭО с помощью ПОАК. Представлены различные классификации первичного тромботического эпизода в зависимости от его влияния на риск рецидива, приведены шкалы для индивидуальной оценки угрозы повторного тромбоза после отмены антикоагулянта и опасности кровотечения при продолжении лечения. Проанализированы результаты длительного применения ривароксабана при спровоцированных ВТЭО. Сделан вывод, что применение ПОАК позволяет безопасно увеличивать продолжительность терапии первичного эпизода, однако общая длительность лечения должна быть основана на индивидуальном балансе пользы и риска."
31114497,Preventable Cases of Oral Anticoagulant-Induced Bleeding: Data From the Spontaneous Reporting System.,"Despite the risk of bleeding is a well-known adverse effect of oral anticoagulants, there is scarce evidence on the preventability of oral anticoagulant-induced bleedings. Therefore, we investigated the potential risk factors related to preventable cases of oral anticoagulant-induced bleedings.
We performed a study using Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) with an oral anticoagulant as suspected drug among those reported through the spontaneous reporting system of Campania Region from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2017. The P-method was used for the preventability assessment of all cases of bleeding.
In total, 58 cases out of 253 (22.9%) were preventable, and the most reported suspected drug was an indirect oral anticoagulant (warfarin). Sixty-eight critical criteria for preventability were identified, all related to healthcare professionals' practices. The most detected risk factor related to healthcare professionals' practices was the labeled drug-drug interaction for both direct and indirect oral anticoagulants.
Our findings describe the most reported risk factors for preventability of oral anticoagulant-induced bleedings. These factors may be useful for targeting interventions to improve pharmacovigilance activities in our regional territory and to reduce the burden of medication errors and inappropriate prescription."
31062938,Rheumatoid arthritis patients' oral health and disease activity.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontal diseases (PD) are common chronic, inflammatory, destructive and progressive diseases that may have similar pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors. RA affects more than 1.5% of the world's population, with a higher percentage of females than males. PD is present in around 20% of the population and has multifactorial etiology. The purpose of this study is to describe patients' self-reported oral health and the association with RA disease activity.
Three hundred patients under treatment for RA from the Division of Rheumatology, Clinical Medicine, North Jutland Region Hospital, Hjørring, Denmark and were eligible for the study. Questionnaires were emailed to the patients and 164 completed answers were received.
The mean age of the group of 164 patients (61% female) was 65 ± 11 years. The average value of Disease Activity Score of 28 joints was 2.31 ± 0.83. Only 12% of responders were active smokers. Patients estimated their status of their teeth and gingiva respectively as poor in 13% and 11% of cases, good, in 46% and 49%, and excellent, both as 40%. Spontaneous and/or provoked gingival bleeding were experienced by 15% and 49% of patients. Only 14% of patients declared feelings of loose or movable teeth and 10% declared difficulties in biting or chewing.
The status of oral cavity reported by Danish patients indicates a significant proportion with symptoms of gingival/periodontal disease, which may negatively influence RA activity and disease management. Cooperation between rheumatologists and dentists is important in oral health management in periodontal inflammation."
31054085,Comparison of Safety Profiles of New Oral Anticoagulants with Warfarin Using the Japanese Spontaneous Reporting Database.,"The development of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has led to an alternative to treatment with warfarin. However, real-world data on comparing safety profiles of NOACs and warfarin are insufficient.
The purpose of this study was to compare safety profiles of warfarin and NOACs using a spontaneous reporting system database.
Adverse event reports spontaneously submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (Japan) between April 2011 and January 2017 were analysed. We performed disproportionality analyses, calculating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
The database comprised 3445 reports associated with warfarin, and 14,269 reports with NOACs. A large number of bleeding complications were detected with the use of both warfarin and NOACs. As for cerebral haemorrhage, the signal scores were greater for NOACs as a class (ROR 25.1, 95% CI 23.3-27) and individual agents (edoxaban: ROR 23.6, 95% CI 18.6-29.9; rivaroxaban ROR 23.9, 95% CI 21.4-26.8; apixaban ROR 28.1, 95% CI 25.4-31.1) than for warfarin (ROR 18.9, 95% CI 16.4-21.7), but showed the lowest value for dabigatran (ROR 9.26, 95% CI 7.76-11). Gastrointestinal haemorrhage had stronger signals for NOACs (ROR 19.4, 95% CI 17.8-21.1) than warfarin (ROR 12.2, 95% CI 10.2-14.6). With respect to calciphylaxis, the association with warfarin was noteworthy (ROR 190; 95% CI, 126-287), but no reports were detected involving NOACs.
Our results may provide useful information for treatment with oral anticoagulants, although further studies with more data are needed."
30992334,Heparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in intracerebral haemorrhage.,"To determine the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhagic complications (IHC) on heparin prophylaxis (low-dose subcutaneous heparin, LDSH) in primary spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (not oral anticoagulation-associated ICH, non-OAC-ICH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-associated ICH and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)-associated ICH.
Retrospective cohort study (RETRACE) of 22 participating centres and prospective single-centre study with 1702 patients with VKA-associated or NOAC-associated ICH and 1022 patients with non-OAC-ICH with heparin prophylaxis between 2006 and 2015. Outcomes were defined as rates of IHC during hospital stay among patients with non-OAC-ICH, VKA-ICH and NOAC-ICH, mortality and functional outcome at 3 months between patients with ICH with and without IHC.
IHC occurred in 1.7% (42/2416) of patients with ICH. There were no differences in crude incidence rates among patients with VKA-ICH, NOAC-ICH and non-OAC-ICH (log-rank p=0.645; VKA-ICH: 27/1406 (1.9%), NOAC-ICH 1/130 (0.8%), non-OAC-ICH 14/880 (1.6%); p=0.577). Detailed analysis according to treatment exposure (days with and without LDSH) revealed no differences in incidence rates of IHC per 1000 patient-days (LDSH: 1.43 (1.04-1.93) vs non-LDSH: 1.32 (0.33-3.58), conditional maximum likelihood incidence rate ratio: 1.09 (0.38-4.43); p=0.953). Secondary outcomes showed differences in functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale=4-6: IHC: 29/37 (78.4%) vs non-IHC: 1213/2048 (59.2%); p=0.019) and mortality (IHC: 14/37 (37.8%) vs non-IHC: 485/2048 (23.7%); p=0.045) in disfavour of patients with IHC. Small ICH volume (OR: volume <4.4 mL: 0.18 (0.04-0.78); p=0.022) and low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission (OR: NIHSS <4: 0.29 (0.11-0.78); p=0.014) were significantly associated with fewer IHC.
Heparin administration for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in patients with ICH appears to be safe regarding IHC among non-OAC-ICH, VKA-ICH and NOAC-ICH in this observational cohort analysis. Randomised controlled trials are needed to verify the safety and efficacy of heparin compared with other methods for VTE prevention."
30946706,Uninterrupted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants during implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations, current consensus recommends uninterrupted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) considering low incidence of bleeding or thrombo-embolic events. It remains unknown whether uninterrupted strategy outweighs discontinuation method for patients receiving NOAC.
From January 1, 2013 to June 1, 2017, we enrolled 100 patients (mean age 78.3 ± 10.2 years, 58% male) with AF taking NOAC for stroke prevention eligible for CIED implantation in a tertiary medical center, Taipei, Taiwan. NOAC was continued without skipping any doses during the surgery. The baseline characteristics, underlying diseases, CHA2DS2-VASc score, and clinical course of every patient were reviewed and analyzed.
Among these patients, 28 were on dabigatran, 61 on rivaroxaban, 10 on apixaban, and one on edoxaban, respectively. There were no adverse events except one case of pericardial effusion and another one with large pocket hematoma. One patient receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation had late onset of pericardial effusion with impending tamponade necessitating pericardiocentesis. Another patient had large pocket hematoma, which spontaneously resolved within 1 month without further intervention. No periprocedural mortality and stroke occurred.
Uninterrupted NOAC during CIED implantations may be an acceptable option especially in patients with high risk for thromboembolism. However, special caution should be paid during defibrillator implantation considering relatively higher risk of bleeding, perhaps due to the larger size of the defibrillator lead."

30883047,Antibody-Based Ticagrelor Reversal Agent in Healthy Volunteers.,"Ticagrelor is an oral P2Y
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial, we evaluated intravenous PB2452, a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds ticagrelor with high affinity, as a ticagrelor reversal agent. We assessed platelet function in healthy volunteers before and after 48 hours of ticagrelor pretreatment and again after the administration of PB2452 or placebo. Platelet function was assessed with the use of light transmission aggregometry, a point-of-care P2Y
Of the 64 volunteers who underwent randomization, 48 were assigned to receive PB2452 and 16 to receive placebo. After 48 hours of ticagrelor pretreatment, platelet aggregation was suppressed by approximately 80%. PB2452 administered as an initial intravenous bolus followed by a prolonged infusion (8, 12, or 16 hours) was associated with a significantly greater increase in platelet function than placebo, as measured by multiple assays. Ticagrelor reversal occurred within 5 minutes after the initiation of PB2452 and was sustained for more than 20 hours (P<0.001 after Bonferroni adjustment across all time points for all assays). There was no evidence of a rebound in platelet activity after drug cessation. Adverse events related to the trial drug were limited mainly to issues involving the infusion site.
In healthy volunteers, the administration of PB2452, a specific reversal agent for ticagrelor, provided immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor, as measured by multiple assays. (Funded by PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03492385.)."
30881279,Increased Bleeding Risk in a Patient with Oral Anticoagulant Therapy and Concomitant Herbal Intake - A Case Report.,"We report the case of a 36-year old male, under stable rivaroxaban therapy for 18 months, who was admitted to our emergency room with sudden onset of hemoptysis. Anticoagulant therapy was given after recurrent spontaneous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a heterozygous Factor-V-Leiden mutation was present. There was no co-medication reported, however, the patient reported a constant intake of three liters of home-brewn ginger tea per day in the last month. The patient was hospitalized to further investigate the reason of hemoptysis."
30861274,Infantile hemangioma: Efficacy of low-dose propranolol and of intralesional bleomycin injection for propranolol non-response.,"Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common form of benign childhood vascular tumor. Most resolve spontaneously, but treatment is recommended in patients who develop complication. Propranolol is recommended as the first-line therapy, while the treatment in the case of non-response to first-line therapy depends on the clinical experiences of each center. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of low-dose propranolol in the treatment of IH, and the outcomes of percutaneous intralesional bleomycin injection (IBI) in patients unresponsive to propranolol.
Medical records of 104 children diagnosed with IH between June 2014 and June 2017 were reviewed retrospectively.
Median patient age was 6 months (range, 3-12 months). Forty-five patients (43.3%) received therapy: 18 (40%) for cosmetic problems and 27 (60%) for lesion-related complications. The most common complications were hemorrhage (15.6%) and impairment in visual function (15.6%). All of the patients received propranolol 1 mg/kg/day as the first-line therapy. Response to treatment was excellent in 35 patients, good in four and poor in one, while five patients did not respond to therapy. The five unresponsive patients received percutaneous IBI at 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/dose as second-line therapy. The response to treatment was excellent in four patients, good in one.
The majority of IH resolved spontaneously. In the patients who required treatment, low-dose propranolol was successful in most, and IBI was effective and safe in the remaining five patients who did not respond to propranolol."
30659003,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura presenting with spontaneous gingival haemorrhage in pregnancy.,"Gingival bleeding is a common intraoral finding, typically associated with inflamed tissues and periodontal disease. It is easily provoked by periodontal probing or toothbrushing. Spontaneous gingival bleeding rarely occurs and may be the only sign of systemic bleeding problems such as thrombocytopenia, leukaemia or coagulopathy. In pregnancy, acute onset of thrombocytopenia may occur in systemic disorders such as severe pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) or the acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The diagnosis and management of such conditions may challenge physicians. It requires a systematic approach with a comprehensive history to exclude causes of gingival haemorrhage such as periodontal disease, anticoagulant therapy, maxillofacial trauma, haematological disorders or a bacterial infection. The authors describe a case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura presenting with spontaneous gingival haemorrhage in pregnancy. This case highlights the fact that medical intervention to correct the underlying aberration of haemostasis is necessary for local measures to stop the gingival bleeding successfully."
30624139,Impact of prosthetic heart valves on pregnancy in Bangladeshi women.,"This study evaluated pregnancy outcome in women with a prosthetic heart valve, especially with the oral anticoagulation therapy that must be weighed against the risk of intracardiac thrombosis.
This multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was undertaken between January 2012 and June 2017. The principal maternal outcome variables included bleeding and thromboembolic complications, infective endocarditis, prosthetic valve thrombosis and heart failure. However, the main foetal outcome variables included miscarriage, mortality, preterm baby, warfarin embryopathy, low birthweight and the mode of delivery.
A total of 265 pregnancies in women with prosthetic heart valves were evaluated in two groups: Group I (n = 182) covers a mechanical valve, while Group II (n = 82) covers a bioprosthetic valve. The mean age of the patients was 25.2 ± 2.5 years and 24.5 ± 5.2 years in Group I and Group II, respectively. Approximately 80% of the patients had normal echocardiography findings. However, Group I (mechanical prostheses) has a higher incidence (11.54%) of thrombus formation in comparison with the bioprostheses. Hemorrhagic complications and spontaneous miscarriage were statistically significant (p⩽0.05) between the study groups. However, normal pregnancy outcome (91.57%) was significantly higher (p⩽0.05) in Group II compared to Group I (61.54%). Mean birthweight and mean APGAR score were found normal in both study groups. Only 2.75% of patients have warfarin embryopathy in Group I. Furthermore, comparison of SF-36 scores for HRQOL (Health-Related Quality of Life) before and after pregnancy were statistically insignificant among the study population.
Proper antenatal care and early risk stratification are the fundamental measures to improve the maternal and foetal outcomes in a patient with a prosthetic heart valve."
30612891,Characteristics of Acute Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Patients Receiving Oral Anticoagulants.,"We investigated the precise clinical and radiologic characteristics of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with direct oral anticoagulant use.
Patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage admitted to our department from September 2014 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and neuroradiological characteristics of patients with direct oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage, and effects of prior treatment on the severity at admission and on outcome at discharge were assessed.
Of the 301 enrolled patients (103 women; median age 68 years), 261 received no oral anticoagulants (86.8%), 20 received warfarin (6.6%), and 20 received direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (6.6%). Median initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores differed significantly among the groups (P = .0283). Systolic blood pressure (P = .0031) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = .0019) were significantly lower in the oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage group than in other groups. Total small vessel disease scores were significantly higher in the oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage group than in the warfarin group (P = .0413). Multivariate analysis revealed that prior oral anticoagulant treatment (odds ratio: 0.21, 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.96, P = .0445) was independently negatively associated with moderate-to-severe neurological severity (stroke scale score ≥10) after adjusting for intracerebral hemorrhage location and various risk factors. There were significant differences in hematoma volume in the basal ganglia (P = .0366).
DOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage may occur particularly in patients with a high risk of bleeding; however, they had a milder initial neurological severity than those with warfarin-related intracerebral hemorrhage, possibly due to relatively smaller hematoma volume, especially in the basal ganglia."
30611267,Anticoagulants is a risk factor for spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage of gallbladder: a case report and literature review.,"The spontaneous rupture of the gallbladder is extremely rare, majority of ruptures occur secondary to traumatic injuries. Here, we report a case of spontaneous rupture of the gallbladder with probably cause of oral anticoagulants.
A 51-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, as well as hypotension and low level of hemoglobin. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 2.5 cm filling defect and discontinuity in the wall of the gallbladder body, and a massive hematocele in the abdominal cavity. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and had been taking daily aspirin for the past three years because of interventional surgery for cerebral aneurysms, but no history of recent abdominal trauma or past episodes of biliary colic. The patient underwent an urgent laparoscopic abdominal exploration and the gallbladder was removed. The pathology just showed chronic cholecystitis and the patient recovered well.
Long-term use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of gallbladder rupture and hemorrhage, which is a lethal condition. Rapid diagnosis and timely surgical intervention are the most important measures to treat the patient."
30587698,Safety of Anticoagulant Therapy Including Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Acute Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Because the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are not fully known, present study aimed to elucidate the current status and the safety of anticoagulant therapy, mainly direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), for acute ICH and anticoagulant-indicated patients. Methods and Results: From September 2014 through March 2017, consecutive patients with acute (<7 days from onset), spontaneous ICH were retrospectively enrolled from a prospective registry. Whether to start anticoagulation was at the attending physicians' discretion, and thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events during hospitalization were analyzed. A total of 236 patients (80 women [34%]; median age 69 [interquartile range 61-79] years; National Institutes of Health stroke scale score 7 [3-16]) were enrolled. Of them, 47 patients (20%) had an indication for anticoagulant therapy (33 had atrial fibrillation, 14 developed deep vein thrombosis), and 41 of 47 patients (87%) were actually treated with anticoagulant therapy (DOACs were used in 34 patients) after a median of 7 days from ICH onset. There was neither hematoma expansion nor excessive hemorrhagic complications during hospitalization after starting anticoagulant therapy.
Anticoagulant therapy was conducted for approximately 90% of anticoagulation-indicated patients after a median of 7 days from ICH onset. The predominant anticoagulant medications were DOACs. Anticoagulant therapy started from the acute phase of ICH should be safe."
30586229,Oral anticoagulation and left atrial appendage closure: a new strategy for recurrent cardioembolic stroke.,"There are no recommendations regarding how to treat cardioembolic recurrent strokes when patients are well anticoagulated. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of combining oral anticoagulation (OAC) with percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in patients with well-anticoagulated atrial fibrillation (AF) with recurrent strokes.
In an explorative, prospective, observational study, LAAC was performed in patients with AF with at least two ischaemic strokes in the previous year, despite good anticoagulation using the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) or Amulet Abbot device (Abbot Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We recorded age, type of AF, CHA
A total of 19 patients were included (mean age, 72.1 ± 9.6 years; mean CHA
Combination therapy with indefinite OAC plus LAAC in patients with AF with recurrent strokes despite good anticoagulation should be considered in order to prevent a new stroke."
30547777,Obstetric and perinatal outcomes of singleton pregnancies conceived via assisted reproductive technology complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus: a prospective cohort study.,"Growing evidence indicates that the risk of obstetric and perinatal outcomes is higher in women with assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, there is little known about pregnancy related complications and co-morbidity in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) following singleton pregnancies achieved by ART in comparison with spontaneous conception (SC).
Two hundred sixty singleton pregnant women conceived by ART and 314 pregnant women conceived by spontaneous conception (SC) were participated in this prospective cohort study. All participants were enrolled after GDM screening through one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and then grouped into GDM and non-GDM groups. Women were followed for pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preeclampsia, antepartum hemorrhage (APH), cesarean section (CS), preterm birth (PTB), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), being small or large for gestational age (SGA or LGA), macrosomia, low birth weight (LBW), respiratory distress, neonatal hypoglycemia, NICU admission and perinatal mortality from antenatal visits to delivery. Confounding factors were adjusted in logistic regression model in order to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs).
Among 260 ART and 314 SC, 135 and 152 women were GDM women, respectively. Higher maternal age and pre-gravid BMI, shorter duration of gestation and lower gestational weight gain were observed in GDM groups (ART-GDM and SC-GDM) compared to those of the SC group. ART-GDM group had a higher risk (95% confidence interval) of obstetric complications including PIH [aOR:7.04 (2.24-22.15)], preeclampsia [aOR:7.78 (1.62-37.47)], APH [aOR:3.46 (1.28-9.33)], emergency CS [aOR:2.64 (1.43-4.88)], and perinatal outcomes such as PTB [aOR:3.89 (1.51-10.10)], LBW [aOR:3.11 (1.04-9.30)] and NICU admission [aOR:4.36 (1.82-10.45)], as well as neonatal hypoglycemia [aOR: 4.91 (1.50-16.07)], compared to SC group. SC-GDM group showed a higher risk of PIH [aOR: 4.12 (1.31-12.89)], emergency CS [aOR: 2.01 (1.09-3.73] and LGA [aOR: 5.20 (1.07-25.20)], compared to SC group. Additionally, ART group had a higher risk of PIH [aOR: 3.46(1.02-11.68), preeclampsia 5.29 (1.03-27.09), and NICU admission [aOR: 2.53 (1.05-6.09)] compared to SC. Insulin requirement (41.8% vs. 25.7%) was significantly higher in ART-GDM group compared to SC-GDM group.
The findings of this study suggest that GDM occurring after ART conception increases the risk of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes."

30240164,Functional outcome and survival following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: A retrospective population-based study.,"Accurate and reliable clinical and radiological predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes are needed to optimize treatment of ICH. The aim of this study was to investigate functional outcome and identify predictors of severe disability or death following ICH.
Retrospective population-based study of spontaneous ICH. Clinical and radiological data were obtained from electronic medical records, and functional outcome estimated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) before ICH and at 3 and 12 months after ICH.
Four hundred and fifty-two patients were included (mean age 74.8 years, 45.6% females). Proportion of fatal outcome at 1 week was 22.1%, at 3 months 39.2%, and at 12 months 44.9%. Median mRS score before the ICH was 1 (interquartile range [IQR] 2); for survivors at 3 months, it was 5 (IQR 3); and at 12 months, it was 3 (IQR 2). Independent predictors of severe disability (mRS of 5) or death (mRS of 6) were use of oral antithrombotic drugs (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8, p = 0.04), mRS score before the ICH (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.2, p < 0.001), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission (OR 8.3, 95% CI 3.5-19.7, p < 0.001), hematoma volume >60 ml (OR 4.5, 05% CI 2.0-10.2, p < 0.001), and intraventricular hematoma extension (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.8-4.2, p < 0.001).
Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with high mortality, and more than one third of survivors end up with severe disability or death 3 months later. Predictors of severe disability or death were use of oral antithrombotic drugs, functional disability prior to ICH, low GCS on admission, larger hematoma volume, and intraventricular hematoma extension."

30202445,Anticoagulant therapy in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis: insights for the clinician.,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent complication in the natural history of patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). The prevalence of PVT in LC is highly variable, ranging from 0.6% to 25% according to different reports. The impact of PVT on the natural history of LC is unclear, but it seems to negatively affect the prognosis of patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) by increasing post-LT mortality and delaying waiting time. The antithrombotic treatment of PVT is still challenging as PVT may often remain asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed, and a spontaneous partial/total regression of PVT is observed in an important proportion of patients, even in the absence of anticoagulation. Recent evidence suggested that the anticoagulant treatment for PVT may favorably affect both ischemic and bleeding outcomes in LC patients. Anticoagulant therapies so far available include unfractioned heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and fondaparinux for acute treatment, and LMWHs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for long-term treatment. No robust data currently support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with LC and PVT, as the safety and efficacy of DOACs in this setting is still unclear. This review summarizes current evidence for the evaluation and management of patients with LC and PVT."
30190288,Remote ischemic post-conditioning promotes hematoma resolution via AMPK-dependent immune regulation.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) produces the highest acute mortality and worst outcomes of all stroke subtypes. Hematoma volume is an independent determinant of ICH patient outcomes, making clot resolution a primary goal of clinical management. Herein, remote-limb ischemic post-conditioning (RIC), the repetitive inflation-deflation of a blood pressure cuff on a limb, accelerated hematoma resolution and improved neurological outcomes after ICH in mice. Parabiosis studies revealed RIC accelerated clot resolution via a humoral-mediated mechanism. Whereas RIC increased anti-inflammatory macrophage activation, myeloid cell depletion eliminated the beneficial effects of RIC after ICH. Myeloid-specific inactivation of the metabolic regulator, AMPKα1, attenuated RIC-induced anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and delayed hematoma resolution, providing a molecular link between RIC and immune activation. Finally, chimera studies implicated myeloid CD36 expression in RIC-mediated neurological recovery after ICH. Thus, RIC, a clinically well-tolerated therapy, noninvasively modulates innate immune responses to improve ICH outcomes. Moreover, immunometabolic changes may provide pharmacodynamic blood biomarkers to clinically monitor the therapeutic efficacy of RIC."
30166867,Oral manifestations of thrombocytopaenia.,"The appearance in the mouth of haemorrhagic petechiae, ecchymoses or blood blisters with spontaneous bleeding is suggestive of a haemorrhagic disorder that may be caused either by functional impairment of platelets or of blood vessel walls, by an abnormal decrease in the number of circulating platelets (thrombocytopaenia), or by defects in the blood clotting mechanism. Thrombocytopaenia from decreased production or increased destruction of platelets may be caused by multiple factors including immune mediated mechanisms, drugs or infections. A diagnosis of thrombocytopaenic purpura can be made when any other disease entity that might be causing the purpura is excluded on the basis of the medical history, the physical examination, a complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear. In this paper, we outline the clinical features of oral thrombocytopaenic purpura and briefly discuss some aspects of its aetiopathogenesis and treatment."
30159173,A Rare Case of Spontaneous Cardiac Tamponade Induced by Concomitant Use of Rivaroxaban and Amiodarone.,"Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approved as an important alternative to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We report the case of an 87-year-old man with past medical history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban and recently started amiodarone for pulseless ventricular tachycardia who presented to our hospital with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed with spontaneous hemopericardium causing cardiac tamponade. The culprit drugs were discontinued, and the patient was treated with emergent pericardiocentesis. Both rivaroxaban and amiodarone are substrates for the CYP3A4 hepatic pathway, and concomitant use can result in increased plasma rivaroxaban levels causing an increased propensity to bleeding. While most physicians are cognizant of the need for renal dosing of rivaroxaban, this article aims to increase awareness of its interactions with drugs that are also metabolized through the same hepatic CYP450 pathway."
30148106,Hepatogenous Diabetes: An Underestimated Problem of Liver Cirrhosis.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in cirrhotic patients is much higher than that in the general population. Two types of diabetes are usually seen in patients with cirrhosis: type 2 diabetes mellitus and hepatogenous diabetes (HD). The HD is an acquired condition which is believed to be caused by impaired insulin clearance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in cirrhotic patients. Increased levels of advanced glycation end products and hypoxia-inducible factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD. Patients with HD typically present with normal fasting glucose, but abnormal response to an oral glucose tolerance test, which is required for the diagnosis. Because the level of glycated hemoglobin is often falsely low in patients with cirrhosis, it does not help in the early diagnosis of HD. HD is associated with an increased rate of complications of cirrhosis, decreased 5-year survival rate, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The major complications of cirrhosis associated with HD include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, sepsis, variceal hemorrhage, and renal dysfunction. Treatment of HD may be difficult as many antihyperglycemic therapies are associated with increased risk of complications in cirrhosis, particularly hypoglycemia. Biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and new medications such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors appear to be safe in patients with cirrhosis. Though insulin therapy is currently advocated, requirement of insulin is variable and is difficult to predict. The liver transplantation usually results in reversal of HD. This review article provides an overview of magnitude, patients' characteristics, clinical implications, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of HD."
30132616,Anticoagulant-associated adverse drug reactions in 2013-15.,"The aim of this study was to obtain a better insight into the adverse effects profiles of the new direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
A review was undertaken of all reports of adverse effects for warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban reported to the regional medicines information and pharmacovigilance centres (RELIS) in the period June 2013-May 2015.
Approximately 65 000 persons used direct-acting oral anticoagulants and 80 000 used warfarin in the period of the study. A total of 409 reports of adverse effects were included. Altogether 55 % of the reports applied to men. In 76 % of the reports for direct-acting oral anticoagulants and 85 % for warfarin, the patients were more than 70 years of age. The most common adverse effects were haemorrhages (48 % for direct-acting oral anticoagulants and 75 % for warfarin), most of which were cerebral haemorrhages (91 for direct-acting oral anticoagulants and 92 for warfarin). Blood clots (therapeutic failure), cognitive effects, headache and hair loss were some of the other adverse effects. The highest comorbidity was among the patients who died. The number of reported deaths was highest for rivaroxaban (1.1 deaths/1000 users) with a declining incidence for apixaban (0.9 ‰), dabigatran (0.7 ‰) and warfarin (0.6 ‰). There were different degrees of reporting for these medications, and the spontaneous reporting system cannot therefore be used to compare the incidence of adverse effects for the drugs.
Adverse effects, including serious effects, may occur when using all anticoagulants. Factors that may increase the risk of adverse effects are advanced age, high comorbidity, reduced renal function, and polypharmacy."
30116281,Anesthesia Management of Vitrectomy in a Patient with Sturge-Weber Syndrome.,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous disorder, characterized by leptomeningeal angiomas involving the oral cavity, trachea, larynx, and face. Herein, we present a case of vitrectomy in a seven-year-old boy with SWS. The patient showed hemangioma on the left side of his face, as well as mental retardation and epilepsy. Preoperative examination revealed no apparent hemangioma in the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, or trachea. However, he was predicted to have difficult airway intubation, as the oral cavity was smaller than the normal size. The minimum Mallampati score was 3-4 due to macroglossia. First, we applied awake intubation, but he failed to follow the commands. We proceeded to general anesthesia with propofol and did not use any muscle relaxants to maintain spontaneous breathing. A laryngeal mask airway was inserted to minimize any harm to possible oral angiomas. The patient was hemodynamically stable and extubated without any complications, such as bleeding or respiratory problems."
30078762,Pellets in the Eye: Cerebral Aneurysm and Encephalomyeloneuropathy as Presenting Syndromes.,"Lead poisoning following retained gunshot pellets resulting in recurrent episodes of encephalomyeloneuropathy is rare and association of intracranial aneurysm with lead poisoning is interesting. The case report describes about a 58-year ayurvedic doctor who was hospitalized for recurrent abdominal pain and limb weakness appearing spontaneously and improving in a few days to weeks. He had 20 such attacks in last 30 years starting at 25 years after the gunshot wound that resulted in retention of 2 lead pellets in his skull. Cranial imaging demonstrated left posterior communicating aneurysm. His initial blood lead level was 206.10 µg/dl, and following chelation with oral d-penicillamine, the lead level declined and was asymptomatic. After 4-year follow-up, he developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was managed with intravascular coiling of the ruptured aneurysm. The gunshot pellets are generally not removed, especially, if they are in inaccessible location. Our patient highlights that such cases should be closely monitored."
30004830,Oral Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Drugs and Ocular Adverse Events.,"To evaluate possible associations between oral anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs and ocular side effects.
Spontaneous reports were collected and evaluated by the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects on the three oral anti-VEGF drugs (pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib) for possible ocular side effects.
Reported side effects include blurred or decreased vision (389 cases); periocular or eyelid edema (273 cases); superficial anterior segment toxicity (270 cases); conjunctival, retinal, or vitreous bleeding (77 cases); retinal detachments (RDs) or retinal tears (RTs) (75 cases); extraocular muscle disorders, including ptosis (51 cases); discoloration of eyelashes (36 cases); retinal arterial or venous occlusions (26 cases); optic nerve disorders, including papilledema and ischemic optic neuropathy (21 cases); uveitis (10 cases); and macular edema (7 cases). Spontaneous reports of possible RD or RT have been associated with pazopanib (31 RDs and 12 RTs), sunitinib (24 RDs and 0 RT), and sorafenib (7 RDs and 2 RTs).
Oral anti-VEGF drugs can cause superficial anterior segment side effects. Pazopanib has been reported to be possibly linked to RDs and RTs. This study suggests that sorafenib and sunitinib are suspected as well. RDs were seldom differentiated into rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRDs) or non-RRDs. The association of oral anti-VEGF drugs with RRD and RT are unclassified although this suggests a ""signal"" requiring further study. The association of oral anti-VEGF drugs with serous retinal detachments, while rare, is plausible. Patients on this class of drugs should be instructed to seek immediate ophthalmic consultation if retinal symptoms occur."
29874535,Mifepristone Pretreatment for the Medical Management of Early Pregnancy Loss.,"Medical management of early pregnancy loss is an alternative to uterine aspiration, but standard medical treatment with misoprostol commonly results in treatment failure. We compared the efficacy and safety of pretreatment with mifepristone followed by treatment with misoprostol with the efficacy and safety of misoprostol use alone for the management of early pregnancy loss.
We randomly assigned 300 women who had an anembryonic gestation or in whom embryonic or fetal death was confirmed to receive pretreatment with 200 mg of mifepristone, administered orally, followed by 800 μg of misoprostol, administered vaginally (mifepristone-pretreatment group), or 800 μg of misoprostol alone, administered vaginally (misoprostol-alone group). Participants returned 1 to 4 days after misoprostol use for evaluation, including ultrasound examination, by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment-group assignments. Women in whom the gestational sac was not expelled were offered expectant management, a second dose of misoprostol, or uterine aspiration. We followed all participants for 30 days after randomization. Our primary outcome was gestational sac expulsion with one dose of misoprostol by the first follow-up visit and no additional intervention within 30 days after treatment.
Complete expulsion after one dose of misoprostol occurred in 124 of 148 women (83.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 76.8 to 89.3) in the mifepristone-pretreatment group and in 100 of 149 women (67.1%; 95% CI, 59.0 to 74.6) in the misoprostol-alone group (relative risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.43). Uterine aspiration was performed less frequently in the mifepristone-pretreatment group than in the misoprostol-alone group (8.8% vs. 23.5%; relative risk, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.68). Bleeding that resulted in blood transfusion occurred in 2.0% of the women in the mifepristone-pretreatment group and in 0.7% of the women in the misoprostol-alone group (P=0.31); pelvic infection was diagnosed in 1.3% of the women in each group.
Pretreatment with mifepristone followed by treatment with misoprostol resulted in a higher likelihood of successful management of first-trimester pregnancy loss than treatment with misoprostol alone.

29745996,How do anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients who suffer ischemic stroke or spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage differ?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases risk of ischemic stroke, and oral anticoagulation (OAC) increases risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study aimed to compare OAC-treated AF patients with an ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) or spontaneous ICH as their first lifetime cerebrovascular event, especially focusing on patients with therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR).
We assumed that in AF patients suffering ischemic stroke/TIA or ICH, patient characteristics could be different in patients with therapeutic INR than in patients with warfarin.
FibStroke is a multicenter, retrospective registry collating details of AF patients with ischemic stroke/TIA or intracranial hemorrhage in 2003-2012. This substudy included AF patients on OAC with first lifetime ischemic stroke/TIA or spontaneous ICH.
A total of 1457 patients with 1290 ischemic strokes/TIAs and 167 ICHs were identified. Of these, 553 (42.9%) strokes/TIAs and 96 (57.5%) ICHs occurred in patients with INR within therapeutic range. During OAC with therapeutic INR, congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR]: 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-4.58) and hypercholesterolemia (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.51-4.19) were more common in patients with ischemic stroke/TIA, whereas a history of bleeding (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.11-0.82) was less common when compared with patients with ICH. In the whole cohort, renal impairment (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.23-2.80) and mechanical valve prosthesis (OR: 4.41, 95% CI: 1.32-14.7) were overrepresented in patients with stroke/TIA, whereas aspirin use (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.91) and high INR (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.33-0.48) were overrepresented in patients with ICH.
In anticoagulated AF patients with therapeutic INR and first lifetime cerebrovascular event, congestive heart failure and hypercholesterolemia were associated with ischemic stroke/TIA and history of bleeding with ICH."
29739453,Spontaneous renal hemorrhage secondary to choriocarcinoma in a man with congenital hypospadias and cryptorchidism: a case report and literature review.,"Choriocarcinoma is a rare malignant germ-cell tumour, most commonly found in adult women. It infrequently presents as spontaneous renal haemorrhage (SRH). Genital malformation and SRH secondary to choriocarcinoma has previously been only reported in females. We present what we believe to be the first case of a male patient with genital malformation (hypospadias and cryptorchidism) and SRH at presentation of choriocarcinoma.
A 25-year-old man presented to the department with intense pain in the right flank region and lower back. Initial investigations showed spontaneous renal haemorrhage, for which an emergency partial nephrectomy was performed. Clinical, radiological, and pathological investigations suggested a diagnosis of testicular choriocarcinoma with metastases to the right kidney, both lungs, and brain. Initial treatment was with a chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin and whole brain radiotherapy; however, 6 months after diagnosis the patient developed liver metastasis, after which time the BEP protocol was switched to ITP with oral apatinib. Despite best efforts, the liver and lung metastasis continued to grow and a decision was made to discontinue active treatment and provide only palliative care until the patient passed away.
Choriocarcinoma is a difficult cancer to diagnose pre-operatively. In male patients with early metastasis, prognosis may be much poorer than in the commoner gestational choriocarcinoma. A multidisciplinary with comprehensive post-surgical intervention is of great importance in the treatment of these patients."
29737900,"Effects of age, gender and menstrual cycle on platelet function assessed by impedance aggregometry.","Platelets are needed to prevent or arrest bleeding and aggregate at the site of injury upon vascular damage. Platelets express receptors for estrogens which might affect the function of the platelets and their hemostatic ability. The aim was to identify possible differences in platelet function related to age, gender, and phases of the menstrual cycle by use of impedance aggregometry with Multiplate. In the first part of the study, platelet function was assessed in 60 healthy individuals (30 men and 30 women) in each of three age groups (20-25, 40-45, and 60-65 years). In the second part of the study, the platelet function was analyzed on four occasions during the menstrual cycle in women without oral contraceptives (OCs) (n = 17) and compared to 19 women on OCs and 18 men of similar age (20-40 years). For the women on OCs, aggregation was analyzed once during the tablet-free week and once late during the period with OCs. The men were sampled once. Women of younger age (<45 years) had significantly higher agonist-induced aggregation response than both men and post-menopausal women (60-65 years). The agonist-induced aggregation response did not differ between phases of the menstrual cycle or OC use. The results suggest that estradiol and/or progesterone affect spontaneous aggregation since it was found to be lowest in the mid-luteal phase. Spontaneous aggregation was significantly lower in women on OCs than in both men and women without OCs. Our findings indicate that fertile age is associated with higher aggregation response capacity of the platelets, possibly to prevent excessive bleeding during menstruation, but this response capacity is not altered during the menstrual cycle or by use of OCs."
29587809,Assessing the outcomes of everolimus on renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in China: a two years trial.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous benign tumors. Renal angiomyolipoma (RAML) occur in up to 80% of TSC patients, which is a leading cause of TSC-related death in adult patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of everolimus in Chinese patients of TSC associated with RAML(TSC-RAML).
In this 2-years, nonrandomized, open-label trial, 18 patients of TSC-RAML, with at least one RAML 3 cm or larger in its longest diameter, were enrolled to assess the efficacy and safety of everolimus therapy in Chinese patients. Everolimus was administered for the first 12 months only. The primary endpoint was a reduction of 50% or more relative in RAML volume to the baseline in the absence of new RAML ≥1 cm and no RAML-related bleeding of grade ≥ 2. The secondary endpoints included: safety, lung function and skin lesions response rate. Serial computed tomography of RAML, magnetic resonance imaging of brain lesions and pulmonary-function tests were performed. Adverse events were investigated using CTCAE v4.0. All analyses used a significance level of 0.05 and were generated in SPSS19.0 software.
The proportion of patients who achieved ≥50% reduction from baseline in the sum of volumes of target lesions increased from 52.94% at 3 months, to 58.82% and 66.67% at months 6 and 12, respectively. During the period of everolimus therapy, among patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) increased by 276 ± 78 ml (P < 0.001), the forced vital capacity (FVC) increased by 433 ± 170 ml (P < 0.001), and the residual volume decreased by 408 ± 243 ml (P = 0.009), as compared with baseline values. The angiomyolipoma volume and the lung function approached, but did not completely return to, the baseline values. The skin lesions response rate was 37.5% after 12 months of therapy falling to 21.4% at 12 months after stopping everolimus. The most common adverse events were mucositis oral, irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, hypertriglyceridemia and headache. The most common grade 3 adverse events were irregular menstruation and mucositis oral. In addition, one patient died from RAML spontaneous haemorrhage during treatment with everolimus, even with reduction in RAML volume of 60.68% at 3 months. A second death was due to epithelioid RAML progression, with metastasis to multiple retroperitoneal lymph node, who died from severe infection one month after surgery.
Angiomyolipomas regressed somewhat during everolimus therapy but tended to increase in volume after the therapy was stopped. Everolimus was well tolerated and showed promising activity in Chinese patients with TSC-RAML, however, we should alert the life-threatening hemorrhage of large RAML in the early period and the lymph node metastasis of epithelioid RAML.

29421002,Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an edoxaban-based antithrombotic regimen in patients with atrial fibrillation following successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement: Rationale and design of the ENTRUST-AF PCI trial.,"The optimal antithrombotic treatment after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, edoxaban was noninferior to a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with respect to the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and was associated with significantly lower rates of bleeding and cardiovascular death in patients with nonvalvular AF. The effects of edoxaban in combination with single- or dual-antiplatelet therapy in the setting of PCI are unexplored.
The ENTRUST-AF PCI trial is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3b trial with blinded end point evaluation involving 1,500 patients on oral anticoagulation for AF. Patients are randomized between 4 hours and 5 days after successful PCI to either an edoxaban-based strategy (experimental arm; 60 mg [or 30 mg according to dose reduction criteria] once daily plus a P2Y
The ENTRUST-AF PCI trial tests the hypothesis that an edoxaban-based antithrombotic strategy reduces the risk of bleeding complications after PCI compared with VKA plus conventional dual-antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF in need of oral anticoagulation. The relative risk of ischemic events between groups will be compared."
29383061,Training in Emergency Obstetrics: A Needs Assessment of U.S. Emergency Medicine Program Directors.,"Obstetrical emergencies are a high-risk yet infrequent occurrence in the emergency department. While U.S. emergency medicine (EM) residency graduates are required to perform 10 low-risk normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries, little is known about how residencies prepare residents to manage obstetrical emergencies. We sought to profile the current obstetrical training curricula through a survey of U.S. training programs.
We sent a web-based survey covering the four most common obstetrical emergencies (pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), shoulder dystocia, and breech presentation) through email invitations to all program directors (PD) of U.S. EM residency programs. The survey focused on curricular details as well as the comfort level of the PDs in the preparation of their graduating residents to treat obstetrical emergencies and normal vaginal deliveries.
Our survey had a 55% return rate (n=105/191). Of the residencies responding, 75% were in the academic setting, 20.2% community, 65% urban, and 29.8% suburban, and the obstetrical curricula were 2-4 weeks long occurring in post-graduate year one. The most common teaching method was didactics (84.1-98.1%), followed by oral cases for pre-eclampsia (48%) and PPH (37.2%), and homemade simulation for shoulder dystocia (37.5%) and breech delivery (33.3%). The PDs' comfort about residency graduate skills was highest for normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, pre-eclampsia, and PPH. PDs were not as comfortable about their graduates' skill in handling shoulder dystocia or breech delivery.
Our survey found that PDs are less comfortable in their graduates' ability to perform non-routine emergency obstetrical procedures."
29345165,Oral contraceptive pills as an option for non-surgical management of retained products of conception - a preliminary study.,"Many Patients with persistent retained products of conception prefers to avoid surgical interventions, such as a dilatation and curettage (D&C) that might pose an additional future risk to their already compromised fertility or obstetric performance. The aim of this study was to the possibility of induced withdrawal bleeding following oral contraceptive administration as a non-surgical treatment for patients with persistent retained products of conception (RPOC). A retrospective study of patients presenting with retained products of conception (RPOC) after failed expectant management or after treatment with PGE1 was performed. Twelve women presenting with RPOC at ≤8 weeks gestation with minimal to mild vaginal bleeding and no signs of infection were treated with oral contraceptive pill (OCP) containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg of desogestrel for 3 weeks. Out of the 12 patients treated, nine women (75%) successfully expelled the RPOC after completing the three-week course of OCPs. The three cases (25%) that did not resolve following OCP treatment had pregnancy products with positive blood flow on Doppler examination. We conclude that OCPs may be a useful medical treatment option for persisting RPOC in selected patients with absence blood flow on Doppler examination wishing to avoid surgical intervention."
29304263,The Prevalence of Adverse Ocular Hemorrhagic Events in Patients Utilizing Oral Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy in Routine Clinical Practice.,"Previous literature assessing ocular hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications in routine clinical practice is limited. This study evaluates the prevalence of spontaneous ocular hemorrhagic events associated with anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.
A retrospective study was performed to identify patients taking anticoagulants (rivaroxaban [Xarelto; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Beerse, Belgium], bivalirudin [Angiomax; The Medicines Company, Parsippany, NJ], lepirudin [Refludan; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Berlin, Germany], dabigatran [Pradaxa; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany], and argatroban) and antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel [Plavix; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York City, NY], prasugrel [Effient; Lilly Medical, Indianapolis, IN], and ticagrelor [Brilinta; AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK]) who presented for an eye examination. Location of hemorrhage, relevant systemic and ocular comorbidities, baseline demographics, and concomitant aspirin use were noted.
A total of 44 patients with spontaneous ocular hemorrhage were identified. Thirty patients had a single episode, whereas 14 patients had multiple episodes (two or more hemorrhagic events). Prevalence of spontaneous ocular hemorrhage on prasugrel (7.2%) and rivaroxaban (3.1%) was higher compared to dabigatran (1.9%), clopidogrel (2.0%), and ticagrelor (2.7%).

29234730,Spontaneous Superior Mesenteric Artery Branch Pseudoaneurysm: A Rare Case Report.,"Visceral arterial pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs) are rare vascular entities with serious consequences. Traditionally, they are associated with trauma, infection, and inflammatory disease, or they can arise as a post-operative complication.
An 87 year old man presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a spontaneous VAPA on a computed tomography angiogram. Serial imaging 4 months previously had demonstrated no aneurysm. Between scans, warfarin was changed to apixaban for aortic valve replacement, but he had no other changes to any other medications. He required urgent endovascular coiling of the pseudoaneurysm, with satisfactory recovery and outcome.
VAPAs are extremely rare, with splenic artery VAPAs the most commonly reported. Regardless, fewer than 250 cases of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm have been reported. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) pseudoaneurysms are the rarest type of VAPAs. Early identification and urgent treatment are warranted because of the associated high mortality risk, with a 50% risk of rupture in any given VAPA. Treatment options range from open operation to endoscopic and endovascular procedures. Apixaban has been proposed to contribute to pseudoaneurysm formation by slow and continuous bleeding that results in the formation of the pseudoaneurysm.
Spontaneous VAPAs are extremely rare and this is the first time a VAPA has been associated with the novel oral anticoagulant ""apixaban"". Urgent management of any VAPAs is important because of the high risk of rupture and potential life threatening haemorrhage."
29127269,Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Outcome After Thrombolysis in Stroke Patients Using Selective Serotonin-Reuptake Inhibitors.,"Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) impair platelet function and have been linked to a higher risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage-an association that may be augmented by oral anticoagulants (OAC). We aimed to assess whether preadmission treatment with SSRIs in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with post-thrombolysis symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) and functional outcome.
A multicenter retrospective analysis was conducted in prospective registries of patients treated by thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. The association between preadmission treatment with SSRIs and sICH (ECASS II definition [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study]) or unfavorable 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale >2) was assessed by logistic regression, taking into account potential interaction with concomitant use of antithrombotics.
Six thousand two hundred forty-two patients were included (mean age, 70.1±14.0 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 9 [5-16]). Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was present in 4.3% (n=266) of patients. Overall, SICH rate was 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5%-4.4%; n=244), and SSRI use was not significantly associated with sICH in unadjusted (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.72-2.27) or adjusted (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.71-2.40) analysis. However, there was a significant interaction of concomitant use of OACs (international normalized ratio <1.7) and SSRI for occurrence of sICH (
Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was not significantly associated with an increased risk of post-thrombolysis sICH in this cohort study. However, subgroup analysis suggested an increased risk of sICH in patients taking both SSRI and OAC. Preadmission treatment with SSRIs was associated with unfavorable outcome, which may reflect the prognostic significance of prestroke depression."
29125055,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral microbleeds and implications for anticoagulation decisions: The need for a balanced approach.","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a common hemorrhagic small vessel disease of the brain, often associated with high risk of spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. When the suspicion of cerebral amyloid angiopathy is raised, clinicians are hesitant in prescribing oral anticoagulation in patients in whom it is otherwise indicated, including the case of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This is one of the thorniest clinical dilemmas in the field currently. In this short Leading Opinion piece by an international panel of clinicians-researchers active in the field, we present our consistent approach and future outlook on oral anticoagulation post intracerebral hemorrhage and in the setting of clinical-radiologic evidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We discuss recent advances and support a more balanced approach with implications for the wider neurological clinical community in regards to successful recruiting this patient population in ongoing and future randomized trials."

This was a meta-analysis of cohort studies with >50 patients with recent ischemic stroke and documented AF, brain MRI at baseline, long-term oral anticoagulation treatment, and ≥6 months of follow-up. Authors provided summary-level data on stroke outcomes stratified by CMB status. We estimated pooled annualized ICH and ischemic stroke rates from Poisson regression. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) of ICH by CMB presence/absence, ≥5 CMBs, and CMB topography (strictly lobar, mixed, and strictly deep) using random-effects models.
We established an international collaboration and pooled data from 8 centers including 1,552 patients. The crude CMB prevalence was 30% and 7% for ≥5 CMBs. Baseline CMB presence (vs no CMB) was associated with ICH during follow-up (OR 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-6.01, 
The presence of CMB on MRI and the dichotomized cutoff of ≥5 CMBs might identify subgroups of ischemic stroke patients with AF with high ICH risk and after further validation could help in risk stratification, in anticoagulation decisions, and in guiding randomized trials and ongoing large observational studies."
28988597,Dosing issues with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for the treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Why we should not underdose our patients.,"Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban - are well established in terms of preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and high thromboembolism risk. When prescribed incorrectly, NOACs are associated with an increased risk of ischaemic events and bleeding. Current NOAC labels explicitly address dose adjustments according to age, body weight, renal function and concomitant treatment with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The required dose adjustments vary significantly from molecule to molecule, thereby creating a complex dose adjustment environment. Furthermore, recommendations support assessment of individual risk using thromboembolic and bleeding risk scores. Evidence-based medicine also provides data about specific patient profiles. In particular, some patients who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as patients on polymedication, are often at higher risk of stroke. More and more patients are being treated with NOACs. The question of appropriate dosing has become important, as studies are starting to show that reduced doses are being prescribed at very high rates. Although these data have not been evaluated in light of individual risk assessments, in everyday practice, physicians are often more concerned about drug-related bleeding than about the spontaneous evolution of the disease (stroke/systemic embolism), leading to high rates of prescription of inadequately low doses. Recent results have shown that only certain risk criteria justify dose reduction. Thus, the right dose needs to be prescribed for the right patient in order to obtain, in real-life practice, the benefits of NOACs that have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials."

Retrospective case series (Canadian Task Force classification III).
University-affiliated outpatient medical center.
Patients who underwent operative hysteroscopy for uterine septum, arcuate uterine anomaly, or multiple submucosal myomas between 1992 and 2015.
In all patients, a PFC was placed in the endometrial cavity at the conclusion of operative hysteroscopy and left in place for 7 days to reduce intrauterine adhesion formation.
A total of 1010 patients who underwent operative hysteroscopy for uterine septum (n = 479), arcuate uterine anomaly (n = 483), or multiple submucosal myomas (n = 48) were studied. All patients presented with infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, or excessive uterine bleeding (in patients with submucous myomas). In all patients, a PFC was placed at the conclusion of the procedure and left in place for 7 days. An 8Fr PFC was used after hysteroscopic division of uterine septum or arcuate uterine anomaly, and a 10Fr PFC was used after hysteroscopic myomectomy. Patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease were excluded. Following PFC placement, patients were prescribed estrogen for 6 weeks and progestogen for the last 10 days of the estrogen course. No prophylactic antibiotic therapy was provided. All patients were discharged to home on the same day. Postoperative pain was well controlled with oral pain medication in 98.5% of the patients. There were no reported postoperative infections, and all patients had an uneventful recovery.
In 1010 consecutive operative hysteroscopies followed by temporary (7-day) PFC placement, no clinically significant uterine infection was observed."
28822583,[Misuse and adverse effects of new direct oral anticoagulants: A prospective observational study in patients admitted to an emergency unit of a French university hospital].,"The use of direct oral anticoagulants (NOAC) is complex: indications, dosage adjustments and precautions. Emergency departments (ED) are increasingly faced with patients receiving NOAC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the misuse and the adverse effects (AE) of NOAC.
All subjects with NOAC admitted to the Limoges University Hospital ED from 1/8/2013 to 1/4/2014 were included in a prospective observational study. Misuse was identified from the NOAC summary of product characteristics and from the 2014 ANSM guideline (indication, dose, co-medications, age, hepatic and renal function); adverse effects were recorded.
A total of 198 subjects were included receiving rivaroxaban (68.7 %), dabigatran (30.8 %) or apixaban (0.5 %). Main indications were embolic prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (78.7 %) and curative treatment of venous thromboembolism (17.2 %). In 16.2 % of the cases, the treatment was not in according to the guidelines: 78 % for prescribing errors (incorrect dosage according to age, renal function, co-medications) and 22 % for wrong initial indication. AE related to NOAC were encountered in 25.8 % patients. Hemorrhagic events were diagnosed in 36 patients with no according to the guidelines in 11.1 % of them. Hemorrhagic events resulted in 3 deaths (8.3 %). Thrombotic events occurred in 15 patients, all these patients were issued with appropriate guidelines.
Through the view of an ED, this study confirms a part of misuse and highlights the risk of spontaneous bleeding of NOAC despite appropriate use."
28687831,Risk of Intraocular Bleeding With Novel Oral Anticoagulants Compared With Warfarin: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"It is unclear if the risk of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants differs compared with warfarin.
To characterize the risk of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken in an academic medical setting. MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized clinical trials published up until August 2016. This search was supplemented by manual bibliography searches of identified trials and other review articles.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were phase 3 randomized clinical trials, enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, compared a novel oral anticoagulant (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) with warfarin, and recorded event data on intraocular bleeding. Data on intraocular bleeding were pooled using inverse-variance, weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis.
The PRISMA guidelines were used for abstracting data and assessing quality. Independent extraction was performed by 2 investigators.
Intraocular bleeding events and associated risk ratio for novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin.
Twelve trials investigating 102 627 patients were included. Randomization to novel oral anticoagulants was associated with a 22% relative reduction in intraocular bleeding compared with warfarin (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99). There was no significant heterogeneity observed (I2 = 4.8%, P = .40). Comparably lower risks of intraocular bleeding with novel oral anticoagulants were seen in subgroup analyses, with no significant difference according to the indication for anticoagulation (P for heterogeneity = .49) or the novel oral anticoagulant type (P for heterogeneity = .15). Summary estimates did not differ materially when random-effects meta-analytic techniques were used.
These results suggest that novel oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of intraocular bleeding by approximately one-fifth compared with warfarin. Similar benefits were seen in both patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Our data have particular relevance for patients at higher risk of spontaneous retinal and subretinal bleeding. These findings may also have important implications in the perioperative period, in which the use of novel oral anticoagulants may be superior. Future studies are required to better characterize the optimal management of patients with both ophthalmic disease and cardiovascular comorbidities requiring anticoagulation."
28597205,[Spontaneous intraocular hemorrhage under oral anticoagulation : Apixaban in comparison to phenprocoumon].,"To determine and compare the frequency of intraocular hemorrhage in patients who underwent oral anticoagulation with apixaban or phenprocoumon.
A retrospective analysis of patients under oral anticoagulant medication (apixaban or phenprocoumon) seen between January 2015 and June 2015 at the department of ophthalmology, University of Muenster Medical Center was performed. Vitreal or retinal hemorrhage in addition to clinical information including age, gender, best corrected visual acuity, concomitant diseases, concomitant medication and therapy were obtained. Bleeding frequency in both groups was compared using Fisher's exact test.
A total of 172 patients were included with a mean age = 74.0 ± 10.6 years, 57.0% (n = 98) male and 43.0% (n = 74) female. In the phenprocoumon group 147 patients (3.4%, n = 5) developed a retinal or vitreal hemorrhage. In the apxiban group 25 patients (36%, n = 9) developed a retinal or vitreal hemorrhage. There was a significant correlation between the group and bleeding risk (p < 0.001).
There was a significant correlation between medication (apixaban vs. phenprocoumon) and bleeding risk in this study population. Further studies with more patients especially in patients with a high risk of hemorhage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy are needed."

To describe SAE reports associated with the oral anticoagulant apixaban from Australia, Canada and USA and to examine associated concomitant medicine use.
SAE report databases from Australia, Canada and the USA were examined for all reports of adverse events associated with apixaban and concomitant medicines from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2014. Disproportionality analysis (proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and reporting odds ratio (ROR)) was conducted for the quantitative detection of signals using the USA database.
There were 97 SAE reports associated with apixaban from Australia, 77 from Canada and 2877 from the USA. Reporting of haemorrhage (any type) was common, ranging from 18% for USA to 31% for Australia. Gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage was the most commonly reported haemorrhage, accounting for approximately 10% of adverse event reports across all countries. Positive signals were confirmed in the USA data (haemorrhage (any type) PRR, 12.1; χ

28540347,"Interdisciplinary Management of Head and Neck Vascular Anomalies: Clinical Presentation, Diagnostic Findings and Minimalinvasive Therapies.","Vascular anomalies are included in the 30 000 rare diseases worldwide affecting less than 5/10 000 people. Depending on their morphology and biological properties, they can cause varied disorders with organ involvement. Almost 60% of vascular anomalies have a predilection for the head and neck region in children. Clinical and scientific effort to establish interdisciplinary management concepts for vascular anomalies is increasing worldwide.
Especially in the head and neck region, clinical impairment and organ dysfunction is associated with cosmetic issues that may represent a physical and psychological issue for the patient. Correct diagnosis, based on clinical presentation and symptoms, is a prerequisite for appropriate therapy, ranging from conservative management to a spectrum of minimally invasive treatment options. We searched PubMed for German and English language published data until December 2016 with focus on clinical studies, review articles and case reports on vascular anomalies with a focus on the head and neck region.
The last ISSVA update in 2014 has contributed to a better understanding of vascular anomalies, classifying them in vascular tumors and vascular malformations. The predominant representatives of vascular tumors are congenital and infantile hemangiomas. Infantile hemangiomas have the ability of spontaneous regression in more than 80%. Patients with symptomatic growing hemangiomas with ulcerations, bleeding complications and restriction of hearing, swallowing disorder, impairment of vision, or cosmetic dysfigurement require treatment. Therapies include oral propanolol, transcatheter embolization and surgery. Vascular malformations tend to progress with patientś age and are subdivided in slow flow and fast flow lesions. Symptomatic slow flow lesions, e.g. venous and lymphatic malformations, benefit from percutaneous sclerotherapy. Fast flow lesions, as arteriovenous malformations, are rare but undoubtedly therapeutically the most challenging vascular anomaly. Depending on location and size, they may require multiple transcatheter embolization procedures for successful occlusion of the AVM.
This review provides knowledge on the current ISSVA classification of vascular anomalies, their clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation and minimally invasive therapy options to encourage the establishment of a comprehensive interdisciplinary management for head and neck vascular anomalies."
28412317,Medical Treatment for Spontaneous Anticoagulation-Related Intracerebral Hemorrhage in the Netherlands.,"Spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage accounts for up to a quarter of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage cases and is associated with higher hematoma volume and a worse outcome. Guidelines recommend rapid anticoagulant reversal but mode and timing are not specified and optimal strategy is uncertain. Variability in everyday practice is unknown.
An invitation to a web-based survey was sent to 85 Dutch stroke neurologists in different hospitals, with questions about importance, timing, and medical management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage.
In total, 61 (72%) neurologists completed the survey. Nearly all (97%) deemed rapid anticoagulant reversal important. A local guideline for management of anticoagulant reversal was used in 80% of the hospitals. Most neurologists (56%) estimated anticoagulant reversal in anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage to start later than intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. Few (5%) thought it was quicker. A minority (28%) of the hospitals started anticoagulation reversal without waiting for laboratory test results or consulting a specialist in hemostasis. Prothrombin complex concentrate was used by all neurologists for vitamin K antagonist reversal and by most (74%) for reversal of thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors (72%). Anticoagulation reversal was initiated at the emergency department according to 89% of the respondents.
Variability in logistics in acute management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage was demonstrated. Anticoagulant reversal is deemed important, but is estimated to have a longer door-to-needle time than alteplase in thrombolysis for ischemic stroke by most neurologists. Several delaying factors were found. These factors might have an impact on outcome."
28399088,[The forensic medical evaluation of traumatic and spontaneous ruptures of the organs affected by the tumours].,"The present article was designed to report the results of the analysis of the cases of traumatic and spontaneous ruptures of the organs affected by the tumours based on the original observations and the literature data. It is shown that the probability of the tumour rupture depends on its histological type, localization, the size, and the distance from the capsule of the affected organ, the degree of involvement of the major blood vessels, the severity of the necrotic changes, the presence of cysts in the neoplasm, and the regimens of radio- and chemotherapy. Moreover, the rupture can be facilitated by anticoagulation therapy, intake or oral contraceptives, pregnancy, concomitant diseases, alcoholic intoxication, splenomegaly, and hypocoagulation resulting from dissemination of the neoplastic process or the metastatic lesions of the liver. Even a minimal injury to the skin can provoke the tumour rupture associated with the fatal hemorrhage. A delayed rupture within a few hours or days is possible.

We also sought to compare spontaneous versus induced puberty in these patients.
Medical records of girls followed in our Pediatric Endocrine clinic for TS from 2007 to 2015 were reviewed.
Fifty-three girls were included, of whom 10 (19%) achieved menarche spontaneously and 43 (81%) received hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Of girls receiving HRT, a younger age at estrogen initiation correlated with a longer time to menarche (P = .02), and a mosaic karyotype was associated with a shorter time to menarche (P = .02), whereas no relationship was seen for body mass index, estrogen regimen, or maternal age at menarche. Nineteen girls (44%) receiving HRT had bleeding on estrogen alone at a wide dose range and were more likely to be on transdermal than oral preparations (P = .01). Girls with spontaneous puberty achieved menarche at a younger age (P<.01) and were more likely to have mosaic TS (P = .02).
Significant variability in the timing of menarche exists among girls with TS. However, age at pubertal induction and karyotype were significantly correlated with age at menarche in our patients. A wide range of estrogen doses is seen in girls who bleed prior to progesterone, suggesting extreme variability in estrogen sensitivity among patients with TS. Girls achieving spontaneous menarche are younger and more likely to have a mosaic karyotype than those with induced menarche. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.

A total of 14 963 patients treated with DAPT after coronary stenting-largely consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel and without indication to oral anticoagulation-were pooled at a single-patient level from eight multicentre randomised clinical trials with independent adjudication of events. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified predictors of out-of-hospital Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding stratified by trial, and developed a numerical bleeding risk score. The predictive performance of the novel score was assessed in the derivation cohort and validated in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial (n=8595) and BernPCI registry (n=6172). The novel score was assessed within patients randomised to different DAPT durations (n=10 081) to identify the effect on bleeding and ischaemia of a long (12-24 months) or short (3-6 months) treatment in relation to baseline bleeding risk.
The PRECISE-DAPT score (age, creatinine clearance, haemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, and previous spontaneous bleeding) showed a c-index for out-of-hospital TIMI major or minor bleeding of 0·73 (95% CI 0·61-0·85) in the derivation cohort, and 0·70 (0·65-0·74) in the PLATO trial validation cohort and 0·66 (0·61-0·71) in the BernPCI registry validation cohort.

28241151,Outcomes Associated With Resuming Warfarin Treatment After Hemorrhagic Stroke or Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,"The increase in the risk for bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy causes a dilemma in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who sustain an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). A thrombotic risk is present; however, a risk for serious harm associated with resumption of anticoagulation therapy also exists.
To investigate the prognosis associated with resuming warfarin treatment stratified by the type of ICH (hemorrhagic stroke or traumatic ICH).
This nationwide observational cohort study included patients with AF who sustained an incident ICH event during warfarin treatment from January 1, 1998, through February 28, 2016. Follow-up was completed April 30, 2016. Resumption of warfarin treatment was evaluated after hospital discharge.
No oral anticoagulant treatment or resumption of warfarin treatment, included as a time-dependent exposure.
One-year observed event rates per 100 person-years were calculated, and treatment strategies were compared using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for age, sex, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and concomitant medication use.
A total of 2415 patients with AF in this cohort (1481 men [61.3%] and 934 women [38.7%]; mean [SD] age, 77.1 years [9.1 years]) sustained an ICH event. Of these events, 1325 were attributable to hemorrhagic stroke and 1090 were secondary to trauma. During the first year, 305 patients with a hemorrhagic stroke (23.0%) died, whereas 210 in the traumatic ICH group (19.3%) died. Among patients with hemorrhagic stroke, resuming warfarin therapy was associated with a lower rate of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (SE) (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.02) and an increased rate of recurrent ICH (AHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.68-2.50) compared with not resuming warfarin therapy, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. For patients with traumatic ICH, resuming warfarin therapy also was associated with a lower rate of ischemic stroke or SE (AHR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-1.11); however, in contrast to patients with hemorrhagic stroke, therapy resumption was associated with a significantly lower rate of recurrent ICH (AHR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26-0.76). A reduction in mortality was associated with resuming warfarin therapy among patients with hemorrhagic stroke (AHR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37-0.71) and those with traumatic ICH (AHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23-0.52).
Resumption of warfarin therapy after spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke in patients with AF was associated with a lower rate of ischemic events and a higher rate of recurrent ICH. Among patients with a traumatic ICH, a similar lower rate of ischemic events was found; however, a lower relative risk for recurrent ICH despite resuming warfarin treatment was also revealed."
28178413,Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Management.,"Spontaneous non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. To improve the devastating course of ICH, various clinical trials for medical and surgical interventions have been conducted in the last 10 years. Recent large-scale clinical trials have reported that early intensive blood pressure reduction can be a safe and feasible strategy for ICH, and have suggested a safe target range for systolic blood pressure. While new medical therapies associated with warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have been developed to treat ICH, recent trials have not been able to demonstrate the overall beneficial effects of surgical intervention on mortality and functional outcomes. However, some patients with ICH may benefit from surgical management in specific clinical contexts and/or at specific times. Furthermore, clinical trials for minimally invasive surgical evacuation methods are ongoing and may provide positive evidence. Upon understanding the current guidelines for the management of ICH, clinicians can administer appropriate treatment and attempt to improve the clinical outcome of ICH. The purpose of this review is to help in the decision-making of the medical and surgical management of ICH."
28123155,Rivaroxaban-induced chest wall spontaneous expanding hematoma.,"Rivaroxaban is an oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor approved in the European Union and the United Sates for the single-drug treatment of several thromboembolic diseases in adults. Ιt has been evaluated in large phase III clinical trials and has been found to have similar efficacy and safety with standard therapy. Herein, is described a very rare case of a rivaroxaban-induced spontaneous expanding chest wall hematoma, that required surgical intervention, in a breast cancer patient. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 7) between the patient's development of hematoma and treatment with rivaroxaban. Physicians should be cautious when prescribing rivaroxaban in groups of patients associated with increased bleeding risk such as patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, patients with certain types of cancers and patients receiving concomitant medications which may alter the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodymamic parameters of rivaroxaban. Anticoagulant treatment should be tailored to each individual patient weighing the bleeding risk against the risk of recurrent thrombosis."
29759698,Thrombus Formation After Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion With the Amplatzer Amulet Device.,"This study sought to define the ideal post-procedural anticoagulant regime and to systematically study the incidence of device-related thrombus.
Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAo) is an alternative to life-long oral anticoagulation in selected patients with atrial fibrillation.
This study included 24 atrial fibrillation patients (ages 79 ± 8 years; 75% male, CHA
Transesophageal echocardiography identified a high rate of device adherent thrombi (16.7%, n = 4 of 23) after a mean of 11.0 ± 8.2 weeks. Thrombus formation occurred under dual antiplatelet therapy (3 of 4) or clopidogrel monotherapy (1 of 4). When compared with patients without thrombi, echocardiography showed higher degrees of spontaneous echo contrast grades within the LAA (3.0 ± 1.0 vs. 1.3 ± 1.1), lower LAA peak emptying velocities (17.5 ± 5.0 cm/s vs. 48.3 ± 21.1 cm/s), and decreased left ventricular function (39 ± 10% vs. 50 ± 13%) in patients with device-related thrombus. All thrombi were observed within the untrabeculated region of the LAA ostium between the left upper pulmonary vein ridge and the occluder disc, indicating suboptimal LAA occlusion.
Device-related thrombus is a frequent finding after LAAo with the Amplatzer Amulet device (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota). Our results emphasize the need for an optimized post-LAAo anticoagulation regimen, a revised implantation strategy, and possibly modified patient selection criteria."
27918771,Association of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors With the Risk for Spontaneous Intracranial Hemorrhage.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase the risk for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an effect that is in theory linked to the strength of inhibition of serotonin reuptake of an antidepressant. However, whether antidepressants that are strong inhibitors of serotonin reuptake actually increase the risk for ICH and the effect of concomitant use of antithrombotics are unknown.
To assess the risk for ICH associated with the use of SSRIs compared with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) among new users of antidepressants and according to the relative affinity of the antidepressant for the serotonin transporter and to assess whether concomitant use of antithrombotics modifies this risk.
This population-based cohort study included new users of antidepressants 18 years or older from January 1, 1995, to June 30, 2014. More than 650 general practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink enrolled patients. with use of a nested case-control approach, each case of a first ICH identified during follow-up was matched with as many as 30 control individuals by age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. Follow-up was completed on October 31, 2014.
Current use of SSRIs compared with TCAs and strong compared with weak serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Incidence rate ratios (RRs) of ICH.
Among a cohort of 1 363 990 incident users of antidepressants (36.8% male; 63.2% female; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [18.5] years), 3036 cases of ICH were identified during follow-up and matched to 89 702 controls. Current SSRI use was associated with an increased risk for ICH (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.35) relative to TCAs, highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04-1.99), and translating in very few additional events. Similarly, the risk was increased by 25% with strong inhibitors (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.54) and highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.90-3.12). Concomitant use of anticoagulants may increase the risk substantially (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.89-3.39).
The use of SSRIs and more generally of antidepressants with strong inhibition of serotonin reuptake are associated with an increased risk for ICH, particularly in the first 30 days of use and when used concomitantly with oral anticoagulants."
27777713,Medication Error When Switching from Warfarin to Rivaroxaban Leading to Spontaneous Large Ecchymosis of the Abdominal and Chest Wall.,"Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapy may be inappropriate if prescription was incorrect, the patient's physiological parameters change, or interacting concomitant medications are erroneously added. The aim of this report was to illustrate inappropriate NOAC prescription in a 78-year-old woman with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and borderline renal dysfunction who was switched from warfarin to rivaroxaban and subsequently developed bruising with hemorrhagic shock and acute on chronic renal failure. Administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate effectively reversed coagulopathy and stopped bleeding. Retrospective determination of circulating plasma levels of rivaroxaban and warfarin confirmed that excessive anticoagulation was likely due to warfarin that the patient probably continued to take although rivaroxaban was initiated. Pharmacodynamic interaction between rivaroxaban and warfarin may not only be additive but synergistic. In patients at high risk of complications, judicious prescribing and dosing of NOACs, and regular monitoring of concomitant medications and renal function are highly recommended."
27707528,"Idarucizumab, a specific reversal agent for dabigatran: mode of action, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and safety and efficacy in phase 1 subjects.","The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) provide a number of clinical advantages over vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of thromboembolism, including improved efficacy and safety, as well as no need for regular monitoring of anticoagulant effect. However, as with all anticoagulants, bleeding complications may occur, and anticoagulant reversal may be required in specific clinical situations, such as in patients experiencing spontaneous or traumatic bleeds, or in anticoagulated patients requiring emergency surgery or other invasive procedures. Therefore, several reversal agents for the DOACs are in development. This includes the specific reversal agent idarucizumab, which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for use in patients treated with dabigatran when urgent reversal of its anticoagulant effects is needed. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds with high affinity to free and thrombin-bound dabigatran, resulting in an almost irreversibly bound idarucizumab-dabigatran complex and thereby neutralizing dabigatran's anticoagulant activity. The reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran by idarucizumab has been demonstrated in animal bleeding models, in healthy volunteers with a range of ages and renal function, and in anticoagulated patients. In the phase 1 trials, at doses of 2 g or greater, idarucizumab resulted in immediate and complete reversal of the dabigatran anticoagulant effects and was well tolerated. In the absence of dabigatran, idarucizumab showed no effect on coagulation parameters or thrombin formation. These findings provide initial evidence that idarucizumab could provide a safe and effective means of reversing anticoagulant activity in patients treated with dabigatran in need of emergency surgery or in emergency bleeding situations."
27640182,The critical care management of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage: a contemporary review.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), defined as nontraumatic bleeding into the brain parenchyma, is the second most common subtype of stroke, with 5.3 million cases and over 3 million deaths reported worldwide in 2010. Case fatality is extremely high (reaching approximately 60 % at 1 year post event). Only 20 % of patients who survive are independent within 6 months. Factors such as chronic hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and anticoagulation are commonly associated with ICH. Chronic arterial hypertension represents the major risk factor for bleeding. The incidence of hypertension-related ICH is decreasing in some regions due to improvements in the treatment of chronic hypertension. Anticoagulant-related ICH (vitamin K antagonists and the newer oral anticoagulant drugs) represents an increasing cause of ICH, currently accounting for more than 15 % of all cases. Although questions regarding the optimal medical and surgical management of ICH still remain, recent clinical trials examining hemostatic therapy, blood pressure control, and hematoma evacuation have advanced our understanding of ICH management. Timely and aggressive management in the acute phase may mitigate secondary brain injury. The initial management should include: initial medical stabilization; rapid, accurate neuroimaging to establish the diagnosis and elucidate an etiology; standardized neurologic assessment to determine baseline severity; prevention of hematoma expansion (blood pressure management and reversal of coagulopathy); consideration of early surgical intervention; and prevention of secondary brain injury. This review aims to provide a clinical approach for the practicing clinician."

We aimed to further investigate the efficacy of long-term entecavir therapy in reduction of the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhotic events and mortality in a large group of CHB-related cirrhosis patients.
The C-TEAM (Cirrhosis-Taiwanese EntecAvir Multicenter) study was a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective-prospective cohort study in Taiwan. We enrolled treatment-naïve patients with CHB-related cirrhosis and baseline HBV-DNA≥2000 IU/mL receiving long-term entecavir therapy and compared the development of HCC, cirrhotic events and mortality with that of a historical untreated cohort.
In total, 1315 entecavir-treated and 503 untreated patients with cirrhosis were enrolled, with median treatment and follow-up durations of 4 and 6 years respectively. Compared with the untreated cohort, entecavir therapy was associated with a 60% HCC risk reduction [hazard ratio (HR): 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.57]. Additionally, an older age, the male gender, HBeAg positivity, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)≥7 ng/mL before therapy were independent predictors of HCC development. Further analysis showed that entecavir therapy significantly reduced risks of variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and liver-related and all-cause mortality. These findings were confirmed by propensity score-matched cohorts in sensitivity analysis. In patients under entecavir therapy, an older age, the male gender, HBeAg positivity, AFP level ≥7 ng/mL before therapy, and 1-year virological response were predictive of HCC development.
Four-year entecavir therapy significantly reduces the risk of HCC, cirrhotic events and mortality in patients with CHB-related cirrhosis."
27619482,Gynecologic symptoms and the influence on reproductive life in 386 women with hypermobility type ehlers-danlos syndrome: a cohort study.,"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), is probably the most common disease among heritable connective tissue disorders. It affects women more than men and causes symptoms in multiple organs. It is associated with chronic pain, skin fragility and abnormal bleeding. These characteristics may hamper reproductive life. We conducted a study to evaluate the gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in women with hEDS. We also explored a possible hormonal modulation of the hEDS symptoms. The gynecologic and obstetric history of 386 consecutive women diagnosed with hEDS was collected by a standardized questionnaire and a medical consultation performed by a senior gynecologist in an expert centre for hEDS between May 2012 and December 2014.
We observed a high frequency of gynecologic complaints, specifically: menorrhagia (76 %), dysmenorrhea (72 %) and dyspareunia (43 %). Endometriosis was not highly prevalent in this population. The obstetric outcomes were similar to those of the general French population for deliveries by cesarean section (14.6 %) and premature births (6.2 %) but the incidence of multiple spontaneous abortion (13 %) and spontaneous abortion (28 %) were significantly higher. A subset of women were sensitive to hormonal fluctuations with more severe symptoms occurring during puberty, prior to menstruation, during the postpartum period as well as on oral contraception.
Increased awareness of the gynecological symptomatology in women with hEDS can help discriminate between endometriosis and thus prevent useless, and potentially dangerous, surgery. This study also suggests that hormonal modulation may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of women with hEDS."

27506776,Spontaneous splenic rupture associated with apixaban: a case report.,"Spontaneous splenic rupture associated with anticoagulant use is a rare but potentially lethal disorder. Lack of prompt recognition can be associated with poor patient outcomes. The use of novel oral anticoagulants is becoming more common and thus consideration of this disorder while evaluating a patient who presents with abdominal pain while using these agents is extremely important. This is the first reported case of spontaneous splenic rupture associated with apixaban.
We describe the clinical case of an 83-year-old white man who complained of sudden severe abdominal pain 5 days into a hospital stay for acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neither he nor his wife reported any significant trauma for the past 6 months prior to his admission. His medical history included chronic atrial fibrillation treated with medications including apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. An urgent abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a large splenic hematoma and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding from which he rapidly declined, developing hypovolemic shock. An emergency splenic arteriogram displayed a patent splenic artery and an embolization was successful in stabilizing him. Due to evidence of recurrent bleeding, an exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy was subsequently performed the following day.
The diagnosis of spontaneous splenic rupture is important to consider in a patient using apixaban who presents with abdominal pain and associated signs of hypotension and anemia. For hemodynamically unstable patients, prompt treatment to stop significant bleeding through splenic artery embolization or splenectomy is warranted and may be lifesaving."
27255877,Emergent Bleeding in Patients Receiving Direct Oral Anticoagulants.,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer clinical advantages over warfarin, such as minimal medication and food interactions and fixed dosing without the need for routine monitoring of coagulation status. As with all anticoagulants, bleeding, either spontaneous or provoked, is the most common complication. The long-term use of these drugs is increasing, and there is a crucial need for emergency medicine service professionals to understand the optimal management of associated bleeding. This review aims to describe the indications and pharmacokinetics of available DOACs; to discuss the risk of bleeding; to provide a treatment algorithm to manage DOAC-associated emergency bleeding; and to discuss future directions in bleeding management, including the role of specific reversal agents, such as the recently approved idarucizumab for reversal of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Because air medical personnel are increasingly likely to encounter patients receiving DOACs, it is important that they have an understanding of how to manage patients with emergent bleeding."
27209716,Spontaneous Gingival Bleeding A Surprising and Sinister Etiology: A Case Report.,"It is rare for a dentist to be confronted with a situation where the immediate well-being of a patient is dependent upon his or her diagnosis. Spontaneous gingival bleeding, as in this case report, may present such a situation. The patient had no remarkable medical history, was not taking medication and had a recent (two weeks) normal CBC. Only by noticing petechiae on the patient's palate and buccal mucosa was the dentist convinced of an underlying clotting problem. A patient visit to his physician confirmed thrombocytopenia due to quinine in the tonic water he was taking."
27166002,Spontaneous idiopathic bilateral adrenal haemorrhage: a rare cause of abdominal pain.,"We describe a case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, flank pain with nausea and no history of preceding trauma. The patient had finished a course of azithromycin and oral methylprednisolone 1 day prior to presentation. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan identified changes suggestive of bilateral adrenal haemorrhage. The patient did not show signs of acute adrenal insufficiency but was started on steroid replacement therapy because of concerns about possible disease progression. All recognised causes of adrenal haemorrhage were excluded suggesting this was a case of spontaneous idiopathic bilateral adrenal haemorrhage, a rarely reported phenomenon in the literature. The patient was discharged after clinical improvement following 6 days in hospital, taking oral steroid replacement."
27147458,Overview of direct oral anticoagulant therapy reversal.,"Strategies for the management of bleeding complications and facilitation of an invasive procedure in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are reviewed.
The DOACs provide clinical advantages versus vitamin K antagonists, including fixed dosing with no routine coagulation monitoring and evidence of a lower risk of bleeding. However, as with all anticoagulants, there is a risk of bleeding complications in patients receiving DOACs, so urgent reversal of their anticoagulant activity may be required for spontaneous or traumatic bleeding events and in patients undergoing emergency invasive procedures. Reversal strategies are dependent on the anticoagulant involved, the location and severity of the bleeding, and/or the urgency of the invasive procedure. The recently approved specific reversal agent for dabigatran, idarucizumab, together with other reversal agents in development will hopefully allow for the emergent reversal of DOACs, without increasing the underlying risk of thrombosis. However, research is required to determine the optimal use of these reversal agents, in terms of choice of agent, dosing, and concomitant management. A systematic approach to their implementation in hospitals is also required to ensure that physicians, nurses, and pharmacists receive appropriate education and have the necessary protocols and guidelines to manage these clinical situations.
Reversal strategies in patients receiving a DOAC need to be tailored to the anticoagulant involved as well as the urgency and severity of the clinical situation. Reversal agents should help facilitate the urgent reversal of anticoagulation in patients with emergency bleeding or who require urgent surgery, though research and education are required to ensure the optimal use of these agents."
26951240,Pharmacological Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus: Selecting the Agent and Route of Administration.,"Opinions are divided regarding the management of a persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Some of the adverse effects associated with a large hemodynamically significant duct, including prolonged ventilation, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and mortality, indicate that active management of infants with large ductal shunts may sometimes be necessary. Indomethacin and ibuprofen are the two US FDA-approved cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors used for the closure of a ductus in preterm babies. Both these drugs are effective in 70-80% of extremely low birthweight infants. Treatment with COX inhibitors may be associated with renal impairment, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, NEC, and spontaneous intestinal perforation when given concurrently with steroids, as well as changes in cerebrovascular auto-regulation. Ibuprofen appears to be a better choice for PDA closure, with a better side effect profile and efficacy that equals that of indomethacin. However, long-term outcome studies of ibuprofen are lacking, and prophylactic ibuprofen is ineffective in decreasing severe IVH. The choice of one drug over the other also depends on local availability of both drugs and the intravenous or enteral preparation. The oral preparation of ibuprofen appears as effective as the intravenous preparation. The use of paracetamol to close a hemodynamically significant PDA has increased in recent years. Paracetamol also decreases prostacyclin synthesis; however, unlike COX inhibitors, it does not have a peripheral vaso-constrictive effect and can be given to infants with contraindications to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It appears to have similar efficacy based on limited data available from randomized trials. Until more data are available on efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes, it cannot be recommended as the first choice."
26926937,Outcomes of interventions for carotid blowout syndrome in patients with head and neck cancer.,"The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes of a patient cohort undergoing intervention for carotid blowout syndrome associated with head and neck cancer.
Patients with head and neck cancer who presented with carotid distribution bleeding from 2000 to 2014 were identified in the medical record. Primary outcomes were short- and midterm mortality and recurrent bleeding. Standard statistical methods and survival analysis were used to analyze study population characteristics and outcomes.
Thirty-seven patients were included in the study. The mean age was 60.1 ± 11.4 years (74% male). All malignancies were squamous cell type, stage IV, in a variety of primary locations: 32% oral cavity, 24% larynx, 16% superficial neck, with the remainder in the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx. Fifty-one percent of bleeds were of common carotid, 29% external carotid, and 19% internal carotid origin. Among the patients, 68% presented with acute hemorrhage, 24% with impending bleed, and 8% with threatened bleed. All patients underwent intervention: 38% received endovascular coil embolization, 30% stent grafts, 22% surgical ligation, and 10% primary vessel repair or bypass grafting. Although major complications were rare, 10.8% of patients had perioperative stroke. Sixteen recurrent bleeding episodes involving 12 arteries occurred in 11 patients (29.73%). Median rebleeding time was 7 days (interquartile range, 6-49). Estimated recurrent bleeding risk at 30 days and 6 months was 24% and 34%, respectively. Of the patients, 91.9% survived to hospital discharge. The 90-day and 1-year estimated survivals were 60.9% and 36.6%, respectively.
Carotid blowout syndrome associated with head and neck cancer carries poor mid- and long-term prognoses; however, mortality may be related more to the advanced stage of disease rather than carotid involvement or associated intervention. Both surgical and endovascular approaches may be efficacious in cases of acute hemorrhage but carry a significant risk of periprocedural stroke and recurrent bleeding."
26894187,Total Extraction as a Treatment for Anaemia in a Patient of Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia with Chronic Gingival Bleed: Case Report.,"Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder affecting the megakaryocyte lineage and is characterized by lack of platelet aggregation on stimulation. The molecular basis is linked to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of αIIbβ3 integrin. Most of the patients with severe Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have spontaneous gum bleeding and persistent low haemoglobin levels. Often these patients are addressed with local haemostatic measures and platelet coverage. We report a case of a severe Glanzmann's thrombasthenia with chronic gingivitis and associated spontaneous gum bleed with chronic low haemoglobin levels, managed subsequently with total dental extraction under appropriate platelet and recombinant factor VIIa coverage. Further follow up of the patient substantiated the treatment protocol with increased and stable haemoglobin levels, thus emphasizing the need for total dental extraction in patients with severe Glanzmann's with chronic spontaneous gum bleed, as a definitive treatment option, which has not been reported so far in the literature."
26889740,Oral aspirin for treating venous leg ulcers.,"Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) or varicose ulcers are the final stage of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), and are the most common type of leg ulcer. The development of VLUs on ankles and lower legs can occur spontaneously or after minor trauma. The ulcers are often painful and exudative, healing is often protracted and recurrence is common. This cycle of healing and recurrence has a considerable impact on the health and quality of life of individuals, and healthcare and socioeconomic costs. VLUs are a common and costly problem worldwide; prevalence is estimated to be between 1.65% to 1.74% in the western world and is more common in adults aged 65 years and older. The main treatment for a VLU is a firm compression bandage. Compression assists by reducing venous hypertension, enhancing venous return and reducing peripheral oedema. However, studies show that it only has moderate effects on healing, with up to 50% of VLUs unhealed after two years of compression. Non-adherence may be the principal cause of these poor results, but presence of inflammation in people with CVI may be another factor, so a treatment that suppresses inflammation (healing ulcers more quickly) and reduces the frequency of ulcer recurrence (thereby prolonging time between recurrent episodes) would be an invaluable intervention to complement compression treatments. Oral aspirin may have a significant impact on VLU clinical practice worldwide. Evidence for the effectiveness of aspirin on ulcer healing and recurrence in high quality RCTs is currently lacking.
To assess the benefits and harms of oral aspirin on the healing and recurrence of venous leg ulcers.
In May 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. Additional searches were made in trial registers and reference lists of relevant publications for published or ongoing trials. There were no language or publication date restrictions.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral aspirin with placebo or no drug intervention (in the presence or absence of compression therapy) for treating people with venous leg ulcers. Our main outcomes were time to complete ulcer healing, rate of change in the area of the ulcer, proportion of ulcers healed in the trial period, major bleeding, pain, mortality, adverse events and ulcer recurrence (time for recurrence and proportion of recurrence).
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each included trial and assessed overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table.
The electronic search located 62 studies. We included two RCTs of oral aspirin (300 mg/daily) given in addition to compression compared with compression and placebo, or compression alone. To date, the impact of aspirin on VLUs has been examined by only two randomised clinical trials, both with a small number of participants. The first RCT was conducted in the United Kingdom (n=20) and reported that daily administration of aspirin (300mg) in addition to compression bandages increased both the rate of healing, and the number of participants healed when compared to placebo in addition to compression bandaging over a four month period. Thirty-eight per cent of the participants given aspirin reported complete healing compared with 0% in the placebo group . Improvement (assessed by reduction in wound size) occurred in 52% of the participants taking aspirin compared with 26% in those taking placebo). The study identified potential benefits of taking aspirin as an adjunct to compression but the sample size was small, and neither the mechanism by which aspirin improved healing nor its effects on recurrence were investigated.In 2012 an RCT in Spain (n=51) compared daily administration of aspirin (300mg) in addition to compression bandages with compression alone over a five month period. There was little difference in complete healing rates between groups (21/28 aspirin and 17/23 compression bandages alone) but the average time to healing was shorter (12 weeks in the treated group vs 22 weeks in the compression only group) and the average time for recurrence was longer in the aspirin group (39 days: [SD 6.0] compared with 16.3 days [SD 7.5] in the compression only group). Although this trial provides some limited data about the potential use of aspirin therapy, the sample size (only 20 patients) was too small for us to draw meaningful conclusions. In addition, patients were only followed up for 4 months and no information on placebo was reported.
Low quality evidence from two trials indicate that there is currently insufficient evidence for us to draw definitive conclusions about the benefits and harms of oral aspirin on the healing and recurrence of venous leg ulcers. We downgraded the evidence to low quality due to potential selection bias and imprecision due to the small sample size. The small number of participants may have a hidden real benefit, or an increase in harm. Due to the lack of reliable evidence, we are unable to draw conclusions about the benefits and harms of oral daily aspirin as an adjunct to compression in VLU healing or recurrence. Further high quality studies are needed in this area."
26749317,Solitary Langerhans cell histiocytosis in an adult: case report and literature review.,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disease that often affects children, but can also occur in adults and smokers. Oral manifestations are unusual and are characterized by bone pain, tooth mobility, necrotic ulcers and local edema. The aim of this paper is to describe a clinical case of LCH in an oral cavity that mimicked oral squamous cell carcinoma.
A male, 63 years old, complaining about a ""wound in the mouth"" for 6 months, without any pain or spontaneous bleeding. His medical history was free of disease. The patient was a smoker for 33 years. Intraoral examination revealed a destructive ulcerative lesion around the upper left first and second molars that resembled an oral squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy of the ulcerative lesion was performed and the microscopic features showed an inflammatory infiltrate rich in plasma cells. Based on this microscopical finding, the final diagnosis was periodontal disease associated with a proliferative non-neoplastic lesion. The patient was referred to a specialized dental surgeon and underwent periodontal therapy including surgical procedures. After that, according to follow-up with the patient, there were no signs of disease remission. The lesion increased in size, although the patient did not complain of any symptoms. A second biopsy was performed and the microscopic features again showed a rich inflammatory infiltrate with mononuclear cells and histiocytic cells, characterized by pale histiocytes with lobed nuclei, resembling a bean. A varying number of eosinophils also were observed, without any evidence of atypical cells present in this infiltrate. An immunohistochemical staining panel was done to determine the nature of this inflammatory infiltrate by using antibodies S-100, CD1a, CD-68 and CD45RO that were positive. These immunohistochemical findings were fundamental for the final diagnosis of LCH. The treatment included surgical extraction of all superior teeth, radiation and systemic corticoid therapies. After 8 years of treatment, the patient is free of disease.
Although LCH is an unusual lesion in an oral cavity, it can be present. Biopsy and a histological exam are essential to establish the diagnosis. Immunohistochemicals were fundamental to exclude malignant lesion and to confirm the diagnosis of LCH."
26732970,New Target-Specific Oral Anticoagulants and Intracranial Bleeding: Management and Outcome in a Single-Center Case Series.,"New target-specific anticoagulants such as the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban are used in an increasing number of patients. Several studies comparing these new oral anticoagulants with vitamin K antagonists revealed a lower risk of severe bleeding complications and reduced thromboembolic events. However, the lack of antidotes is a challenging issue in the treatment of traumatic or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage.
A retrospective analysis of patients with intracranial bleeding under new oral anticoagulants was performed; these patients were admitted to our department between January 2011 and November 2014. Treatment, reversal management of blood coagulopathy, and outcome of the patients were analyzed.
Seventeen patients were included. The median age was 80.4 years. Seven patients were treated with dabigatran and 10 with rivaroxaban. Eight patients had traumatic intracranial bleeding and 9 patients had spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Complex perioperative hematologic treatment followed. In 9 cases, the clinical outcome was devastating with severe neurologic deficits (n = 2), comatose status (n = 4), or death (n = 3). Patients with the indication for acute surgical treatment had a high risk for a critical clinical outcome.
Only a few case reports have analyzed the clinical course and the outcome after intracranial bleeding under new target-specific oral anticoagulants. Here, one of the first larger series is presented. Because of the lack of reversibility of the anticoagulative effects and the overall risks with geriatric patients, surgical treatment should be delayed as long as possible and comorbidities have to be considered."
26692056,Retinal and vitreous hemorrhage after traumatic impact of dexamethasone implant in a vitrectomized eye.,"To report a case of retinal and vitreous hemorrhage after intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implant (0.7 mg Ozurdex) and its management.
A 49-year-old man treated for diabetic macular edema developed vitreous and retinal hemorrhage after intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implant caused by a retinal impact during the injection procedure.
Retinal and vitreous hemorrhage absorbed spontaneously after 3 months. No retinal damage was detected. Intraocular pressure increased to 38 mm Hg after the injection and was well-controlled by medical therapy (dorzolamide hydrochloride-timolol maleate ophthalmic solution administered BID and oral acetazolamide 250 mg once a day). Since the surgeon performed the injection carefully without exerting any pressure on the eye, a device malfunction likely caused the implant to be injected too powerfully.
Vitreous and retinal hemorrhage can occur after direct impact of an Ozurdex implant against the retina during the injection. So far this has never been described in the literature. Intraocular pressure elevation can worsen due to trabecular blockage by red blood cells. Spontaneous resolution can occur but vitrectomy is a therapeutic option if the hemorrhage persists."
26670299,Genetic risk factors for spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.,"Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality of all stroke subtypes. Established risk factors for ICH include hypertension, alcohol use, current cigarette smoking, and use of oral anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents. Familial aggregation of ICH has been observed, and the heritability of ICH risk has been estimated at 44%. Few genes have been found to be associated with ICH at the population level, and much of the evidence for genetic risk factors for ICH comes from single studies conducted in relatively small and homogenous populations. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge of genetic variants associated with primary spontaneous ICH. Two variants of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) - which also contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy - are the most likely candidates for variants that increase the risk of ICH. Other promising candidates for risk alleles in ICH include variants of the genes ACE, PMF1/SLC25A44, COL4A2, and MTHFR. Other genetic variants, related to haemostasis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and the CNS microenvironment, have been linked to ICH in single candidate gene studies. Although evidence for genetic contributions to the risk of ICH exists, we do not yet fully understand how and to what extent this information can be utilized to prevent and treat ICH."
26666354,Triclosan causes spontaneous abortion accompanied by decline of estrogen sulfotransferase activity in humans and mice.,"Triclosan (TCS), an antibacterial agent, is identified in serum and urine of humans. Here, we show that the level of urinary TCS in 28.3% patients who had spontaneous abortion in mid-gestation were increased by 11.3-fold (high-TCS) compared with normal pregnancies. Oral administration of TCS (10 mg/kg/day) in mice (TCS mice) caused an equivalent urinary TCS level as those in the high-TCS abortion patients. The TCS-exposure from gestation day (GD) 5.5 caused dose-dependently fetal death during GD12.5-16.5 with decline of live fetal weight. GD15.5 TCS mice appeared placental thrombus and tissue necrosis with enhancement of platelet aggregation. The levels of placenta and plasma estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) mRNA and protein in TCS mice or high-TCS abortion patients were not altered, but their EST activities were significantly reduced compared to controls. Although the levels of serum estrogen (E2) in TCS mice and high-TCS abortion patients had no difference from controls, their ratio of sulfo-conjugated E2 and unconjugated E2 was reduced. The estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182,780 prevented the enhanced platelet aggregation and placental thrombosis and attenuated the fetal death in TCS mice. The findings indicate that TCS-exposure might cause spontaneous abortion probably through inhibition of EST activity to produce placental thrombosis."
26642102,"AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, AMERICAN COLLEGE OF ENDOCRINOLOGY, AND ANDROGEN EXCESS AND PCOS SOCIETY DISEASE STATE CLINICAL REVIEW: GUIDE TO THE BEST PRACTICES IN THE EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME - PART 2.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Androgen Excess Society aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2014. Insulin resistance is believed to play an intrinsic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The mechanism by which insulin resistance or insulin give rise to oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, however, is unclear. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index (BMI) and yearly in women with IGT. Compared with BMI- and age-matched controls, young, lean PCOS women have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size, higher very-low-density lipoprotein particle number, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, and borderline lower LDL size. Statins have been shown to lower testosterone levels either alone or in combination with oral contraceptives (OCPs) but have not shown improvement in menses, spontaneous ovulation, hirsutism, or acne. Statins reduce total and LDL cholesterol but have no effect on HDL, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in PCOS women, in contrast to the general population. There have been no long-term studies of statins on clinical cardiac outcomes in women with PCOS. Coronary calcification is more prevalent and more severe in PCOS than in controls. In women under 60 years of age undergoing coronary angiography, the presence of polycystic ovaries on sonography has been associated with more arterial segments with >50% stenosis, but the relationship between PCOS and actual cardiovascular events remains unclear. Therapies for PCOS are varied in their effects and targets and include both nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic approaches. Weight loss is the primary therapy in PCOS--reduction in weight of as little as 5% can restore regular menses and improve response to ovulation- inducing and fertility medications. Metformin in premenopausal PCOS women has been associated with a reduction in features of MetS. Clamp studies using ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone combination failed to reveal evidence of an increase in either peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance. Subjects with PCOS have a 1.5-times higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolic disease and a 3.7-fold greater effect with OCP use compared with non-PCOS subjects. There is currently no genetic test to screen for or diagnose PCOS, and there is no test to assist in the choice of treatment strategies. Persistent bleeding should always be investigated for pregnancy and/or uterine pathology--including transvaginal ultrasound exam and endometrial biopsy--in women with PCOS. PCOS women can have difficulty conceiving. Those who become pregnant are at risk for gestational diabetes (which should be evaluated and managed appropriately) and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Assessment of a woman with PCOS for infertility involves evaluating for preconceptional issues that may affect response to therapy or lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and evaluating the couple for other common infertility issues that may affect the choice of therapy, such as a semen analysis. Women with PCOS have multiple factors that may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy, including a high prevalence of IGT--a clear risk factor for gestational diabetes--and MetS with hypertension, which increases the risk for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women should be screened and treated for hypertension and diabetes prior to attempting conception. Women should be counseled about weight loss prior to attempting conception, although there are limited clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit to this recommendation. Treatment for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility should begin with an oral agent such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor."
26559278,Spontaneous Intra-Abdominal Hemorrhage Due to Rupture of Jejunal Artery Aneurysm in Behcet Disease: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Rupture of jejunal artery aneurysm is a very rare event resulting in life-threatening hemorrhage in Behcet disease (BD). We report a case of ruptured jejunal artery aneurysm in a 35-year-old patient with BD. The patient had a 1-year history of intermittent abdominal pain caused by superior mesenteric artery aneurysm with thrombosis. Anticoagulation treatment showed a good response. Past surgical history included stenting for aortic pseudoaneurysm. On admission, the patient underwent an urgent operation due to sudden hemorrhagic shock. Resection was performed for jejunal artery aneurysm and partial ischemia of intestine. The patient was diagnosed with BD, based on a history of recurrent oral and skin lesions over the past 6 years. Treatment with anti-inflammatory medications showed a good response during the 8-month follow-up.An increased awareness of BD and its vascular complications is essential. Aneurysms in BD involving jejunal artery are rare, neglected and require proper management to prevent rupture and death. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of jejunal artery aneurysm caused by BD."
26457031,Risk factors for adverse in-hospital outcomes in acute colonic diverticular hemorrhage.,"To investigate the factors associated with transfusion, further bleeding, and prolonged length of stay.
In total, 153 patients emergently hospitalized for diverticular bleeding who were examined by colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled. Patients in whom the bleeding source was identified received endoscopic treatment such as clipping or endoscopic ligation. After spontaneous cessation of bleeding with conservative treatment or hemostasis with endoscopic treatment, all patients were started on a liquid food diet and gradually progressed to a solid diet over 3 d, and were discharged. At enrollment, we assessed smoking, alcohol, medications [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)], low-dose aspirin, and other antiplatelets, warfarin, acetaminophen, and oral corticosteroids), and co-morbidities [hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cerebro-cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. The in-hospital outcomes were need for transfusion, further bleeding after spontaneous cessation of hemorrhage, and length of hospital stay. The odds ratio (OR) for transfusion need, further bleeding, and prolonged length of stay were estimated by logistic regression analysis.
No patients required angiographic embolization or surgery. Stigmata of bleeding occurred in 18% of patients (27/153) and was treated by endoscopic procedures. During hospitalization, 40 patients (26%) received a median of 6 units of packed red blood cells. Multivariate analysis revealed that female sex (OR = 2.5, P = 0.02), warfarin use (OR = 9.3, P < 0.01), and CKD (OR = 5.9, P < 0.01) were independent risk factors for transfusion need. During hospitalization, 6 patients (3.9%) experienced further bleeding, and NSAID use (OR = 5.9, P = 0.04) and stigmata of bleeding (OR = 11, P < 0.01) were significant risk factors. Median length of hospital stay was 8 d. Multivariate analysis revealed that age > 70 years (OR = 2.1, P = 0.04) and NSAID use (OR = 2.7, P = 0.03) were independent risk factors for prolonged hospitalization (≥ 8 d).
In colonic diverticular bleeding, female sex, warfarin, and CKD increased the risk of transfusion requirement, while advanced age and NSAID increased the risk of prolonged hospitalization."
26455289,Periodontal disease preceding osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in cancer patients receiving antiresorptives alone or combined with targeted therapies: report of 5 cases and literature review.,"We present clinical and radiologic data of periodontal tissue involvement preceding the appearance of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in 5 patients with solid tumors, who received antiresorptives alone or in combination with targeted therapies.
Five patients with osteonecrosis before dental extraction were studied.
Periodontal involvement was evidenced by pain, bleeding, fistula, purulence, swelling, periodontal pocket, and tooth mobility. Combined endoperiodontal lesions were considered in 1 patient. Duration of symptoms before ONJ diagnosis lasted 8 to 24 weeks. Routine therapy was performed in 2 of 5 patients. Widening of the periodontal ligament was observed in 4 patients, and dense alveolar bone was seen in 1 patient. Local complications of ONJ required dental extractions in 4 of 5 patients. Spontaneous tooth exfoliation was observed in 1 patient. Alveolar bone biopsies, after the extraction in 2 patients, confirmed osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis healed in 2 patients--1 after the dental extraction and 1 after 3 dental extractions and surgical debridement. Postextraction socket healed in 1 patient, and the area with exposed bone remained asymptomatic. Osteonecrosis progressed in 2 patients.
Clinical and radiologic signs of periodontal tissue involvement, before dental extraction in patients treated with antiresorptives alone or in combination with targeted therapy, may represent developing osteonecrosis."
26426231,Diagnosis and Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"This article updates neurologists on recent insights and management strategies of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
Blood pressure reduction likely improves outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, although not by the expected mechanism of reducing hematoma growth. One formulation of prothrombin complex concentrate for reversing severe bleeding associated with warfarin is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and specific reversal therapies for the novel oral anticoagulants are in development. Neurologic monitoring frequently detects ICH worsening that requires an intervention. Platelet transfusion and pharmacologic platelet activation are promising and often used as part of patient management but have not yet been shown to improve patient outcomes.
Measurable progress continues toward establishing effective therapies to improve outcomes in patients with ICH. Blood pressure reduction and reversal of medications that exacerbate bleeding are likely to improve outcomes. Recommendations for neuromonitoring will help clinicians at the bedside attend to the most important abnormalities and optimize later quality of life. This article reviews standards for diagnosis and severity of ICH, monitoring and treatment of complications in the hospital, available interventions, and the measurement of outcomes."
26404777,Acute Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a 1-Year-Old White Male: Diagnostic Evaluation and Flow Cytometric Analysis.,"1-year-old white male.
Bruising, pallor, and decreased activity.
Bruising had first been noticed on both lower extremities 3 weeks before the day he arrived at the hospital seeking treatment. The patient experienced a fall at that time that resulted in a lip laceration, which resolved spontaneously without increased bleeding time. His activity level was normal until the day of hospital admission, when he was noticed to be somewhat lethargic and pale. He was brought to the Emergency Department after 2 episodes of epistaxis, which resolved spontaneously.
Treated with amoxicillin the previous week for tonsillitis.
Mother has history of anemia.
The patient appeared pale and tired, with dry and pale oral mucosa. Dried blood was noted on the nares bilaterally. The boy was noted to have extensive ecchymosis to the upper and lower extremities, chest, and back; he was also noted to have moderate petechiae with a similar distribution. No organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was present, but mild abdominal distension was noted."
26398129,Sevoflurane-Based General Anesthesia Induction via Nasopharyngeal Endotracheal Tube Prior to Definitive Airway Control in Pediatric Oral Tumors.,"Airway-related tumors in pediatrics are always challenging for anesthesiologists. We present 2 cases of friable, bleeding large tumors in the oral cavity where conventional methods of securing the airway were not possible. Induction of general anesthesia could potentially lead to complete airway collapse and catastrophic obstruction in such cases. Awake fibrotic intubation is limited in pediatric patients. We describe the innovative use of an endotracheal tube inserted blindly as a nasopharyngeal airway guided by end-tidal carbon dioxide trace. This allowed us to bypass the anatomical obstruction and induce anesthesia using sevoflurane in high-flow oxygen. By the described technique, we were able to maintain and assist the spontaneous breathing of the child as well. We also highlight limitations of the use of a conventional nasopharyngeal airway in such situations."
26366365,Conservative treatment of idiopathic spontaneous pneumoperitoneum in a bedridden patient: a case report.,"Idiopathic spontaneous pneumoperitoneum is a rare condition that is characterized by intraperitoneal gas for which no clear etiology has been identified. We report here a case of idiopathic spontaneous pneumoperitoneum, which was successfully managed by conservative treatment. A 77-year-old woman who was bedridden with speech disability as a sequela of brain hemorrhage presented at our hospital with a 1-day history of abdominal distention. On physical examination, she had stable vital signs and slight epigastric tenderness on deep palpation without any other signs of peritonitis. A chest radiograph and computed tomography showed that a large amount of free gas extended into the upper abdominal cavity. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no perforation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic spontaneous pneumoperitoneum, and conservative treatment was selected. The abdominal distension rapidly disappeared, and the patient resumed oral intake on the 5th hospital day without deterioration of symptoms. Knowledge of this rare disease and accurate diagnosis with findings of clinical imaging might contribute towards refraining from unnecessary laparotomy."
26291811,Effect of oral contraceptives containing estradiol and nomegestrol acetate or ethinyl-estradiol and chlormadinone acetate on primary dysmenorrhea.,"To study the three cycles effect on primary dysmenorrhea of the monophasic 24/4 estradiol/nomegestrol acetate (E2/NOMAC) and of the 21/7 ethinyl-estradiol/chlormadinone acetate (EE/CMA) oral contraceptive. The tolerability and the effect of both preparations on metabolism and health-related quality of life were also evaluated.
Prospective observational cohort study.
Tertiary gynecologic center for pelvic pain.
Subjects with primary dysmenorrhea requiring an oral contraceptive, who spontaneously selected either E2/NOMAC (n = 20) or EE/CMA (n = 20).
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for dysmenorrhea, Short Form-36 questionnaire for health-related quality of life, lipoproteins and days of menstrual bleeding (withdrawal bleeding during oral contraceptive).
Mean age and body mass index (BMI) were similar between the two groups. The final analysis was performed on 34 women, 15 in E2/NOMAC and 19 in EE/CMA group. Compliance with treatment was significantly higher with EE/CMA (100%) than E2/NOMAC (75%) (p = 0.02). Both treatments significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced VAS of primary dysmenorrhea, similarly (E2/NOMAC by a mean of 74.7%, EE/CMA by a mean of 78.4%; p = 0.973). Only E2/NOMAC significantly increased SF-36 score (p = 0.001), both in physical (p = 0.001) and mental domains (p = 0.004). The mean number of days of menstrual bleeding was significantly reduced in E2/NOMAC group (from 4.86 ± 1.20 d to 2.64 ± 1.59 d, p = 0.0005 versus baseline, p = 0.007 versus EE/CMA group). BMI did not vary in either group. E2/NOMAC did not change lipoproteins and apoproteins while EE/CMA increased total cholesterol (p = 0.0114), HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.0008), triglycerides (p = 0.002), apoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1; p = 0.0006) and apopoprotein-B (Apo-B; p = 0.008), decreasing LDL/HDL ratio (p = 0.024).
Both oral contraceptives reduced similarly primary dysmenorrhea, with E2/NOMAC also reducing withdrawal bleedings and being neutral on lipid metabolism."
26195125,Pregnancy outcome after exposure to the novel oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in women at suspected risk for thromboembolic events: a case series from the German Embryotox Pharmacovigilance Centre.,"New oral anticoagulants are increasingly used in women of childbearing age, but apart from one case report there is no published experience with rivaroxaban exposure during pregnancy.
From October 2008 to December 2014, the German Embryotox Pharmacovigilance Centre identified 63 exposed pregnancies among 94 requests concerning rivaroxaban use during childbearing age. Follow-up included paediatric checks until 6 weeks after birth.
All pregnancies with completed follow-up were exposed at least during the first trimester. Treatment indications included venous thromboembolism, knee surgery, and atrial fibrillation. 37 pregnancies were prospectively ascertained and resulted in six spontaneous abortions, eight elective terminations of pregnancy, and 23 live births. All women had discontinued rivaroxaban after recognition of pregnancy, mostly in the first trimester, but in one woman treatment continued until gestational week 26. There was one major malformation (conotruncal cardiac defect) among the 37 prospectively ascertained pregnancies in a woman with complex medication and a previous foetus with cardiac malformation without exposure to rivaroxaban. Only one case of bleeding concerning a retrospective report of surgery for missed abortion was observed in our case series.
Our results might give reassurance to those women, who were inadvertently exposed to rivaroxaban in early pregnancy. However, our limited cohort size does not allow ruling out an increased malformation risk and does not support the use of rivaroxaban during pregnancy. In all cases of (inadvertent) rivaroxaban exposure during 1st trimester, anticoagulation regimen should be reconsidered and a detailed ultrasound assessment recommended to confirm normal foetal development."
26095120,Spontaneous Hemopericardium in a Patient Receiving Apixaban Therapy: First Case Report.,"Apixaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) indicated for prevention of embolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The agent is associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Hemopericardium is a life-threatening bleeding event that is rarely caused by anticoagulants. We describe the case of a 76-year-old woman who was diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and treated with apixaban. Six weeks later, she was hospitalized after complaints of weakness and dizziness, and a chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly. Further imaging, including a computed tomography scan and transthoracic echocardiogram, confirmed a diagnosis of hemopericardium. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of hemopericardium associated with apixaban therapy. This report, along with two previous cases reports of hemopericardium associated with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, emphasizes the need for careful use of NOACs and for further research to identify an antidote or other method for controlling hemorrhage secondary to NOACs in an acute setting. Furthermore, clinicians should consider hemopericardium in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with anticoagulants, including NOACs, who present with cardiomegaly."
25895835,Bleeding and thrombosis in a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome using norethisterone: a case report.,"Antiphospholipid syndrome is known to be associated with the occurrence of venous and/or arterial thrombosis. There are several factors that might trigger the risk of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome, including drugs, however bleeding is rare. Only a few cases of antiphospholipid syndrome have reported simultaneous bleeding and thrombosis, and only a few of these cases have reported thrombosis induced by norethisterone when used by patients with an underlying risk factor for thromboembolism.
We report the case of a 35-year-old Saudi woman diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome with a history of several spontaneous miscarriages and two previous lower limb deep vein thromboses. She had used norethisterone to postpone her menstruation and presented to our institution with severe menorrhagia. During admission, she developed thrombocytopenia, and at the same time she was found to have extensive inferior vena cava and bilateral common iliac thrombosis.
This case report is of interest to rheumatologists, hematologists and radiologists because we have found that the presence of bleeding and thrombocytopenia do not preclude the concomitant occurrence of thrombotic complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. Norethisterone is normally safe to take, but it is not suitable for patients with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Also, the simultaneous management of thrombosis and heavy vaginal bleeding is a challenge for clinicians since there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the management of these patients."
25842756,Risk factors for subdural bleeding in elderly population.,"In the elderly, a larger proportion of the intracranial bleeds is related to non-traumatic causes or is caused by slight trauma--such that in a younger patient would not be expected to cause a bleed. In clinical practice, there is a prevailing impression that these bleeds, especially subdural hematomas of chronic and sub-chronic duration with or without acutization (evidence of ""fresh"" bleeding) are in many cases related directly to the use of anticoagulant therapy. A retrospective survey of medical documentation was performed for patients treated at the Neurosurgery Clinic of KBC Rijeka during the period of 2011 and 2012. Statistical analysis showed a significantly greater incidence of spontaneous SDH (subdural hematoma) in patients taking oral anticoagulation therapy (Fisher exact test, p < 0.01). In the article 3 typical cases of such patients are also presented. This survey confirmed the existence of a relationship between oral anticoagulant therapy and SDH, in particular the subgroup of ""spontaneous"" SDH. A larger study is planned."
25835642,Double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing misoprostol and oxytocin for management of the third stage of labor in a Nigerian hospital.,"To compare the efficacy of oral misoprostol with that of oxytocin for active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL).
A double-blind randomized control trial was undertaken at a center in Ilorin, Nigeria, between January and June 2013. Every other eligible patient (in the first stage of labor at term, to have a spontaneous vaginal delivery, and no/low risk of postpartum hemorrhage [PPH]) were randomly assigned with computer-generated random numbers to receive oral misoprostol (600μg) plus placebo injection or oral placebo plus oxytocin injection (1mL of 10IU) in the third stage of labor. The primary outcome was amount of blood loss during delivery.
Mean postpartum blood loss was 325.85±164.72mL in the 100 patients given misoprostol and 303.95±163.33mL in the 100 patients given oxytocin (P=0.391). PPH (≥500mL blood loss) was recorded in 15 (15.0%) patients given misoprostol and 14 (14.0%) given oxytocin (P=0.841). Shivering, pyrexia, and diarrhea were all significantly more common in the misoprostol group (P<0.01 for all).
The efficacy of oral misoprostol was similar to that of intramuscular oxytocin. Adverse effects associated with misoprostol were transient and self-limiting. Thus, oral misoprostol is efficacious and a good alternative to oxytocin for AMTSL. Pan African Clinical Trials Registry:PACTR201407000825227."
25688458,Prevention of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications in surgical patients with inherited factor VII deficiency.,"Inherited factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive hemorrhagic disorder. The major clinical symptoms include: bleeding from the oral cavity, epistaxis, menorrhagia, spontaneous hemarthros, bleeding to the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, and perioperative bleeding. The aim of this study was to present our experience in preventing bleeding and hemorrhagic disorders in surgical patients with inherited FVII deficiency by using recombinant activated FVIIa (rFVIIa), and with prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). In 2002-2011, 17 patients with inherited FVII deficiency underwent surgery. Thirteen patients had isolated FVII deficiency below 10%, and four patients 10-25. To prevent bleeding and hemorrhagic complications, we administered small single doses of rFVIIa (Novo-Seven) at 12-h intervals to 15 patients on surgery day and on day 1 following surgery, then every 24 h; PCCs were administered (Prothromplex, Beriplex) to two patients. No symptoms of bleeding, hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications were observed in the perioperative and 1-month observation period in surgical patients treated with rFVIIa. One patient treated with PCC (Prothromplex) developed distal deep vein thrombosis on postoperative day 7. The results suggest that small, single, every 12-h doses of rFVIIa (NovoSeven) and in next days after surgery one time every 24 h are well tolerated and effective for prevention of thromboembolic, bleeding and hemorrhagic complications in FVII-deficient patients. Antithrombotic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin should be applied in patients using PCCs."
25622536,Clinical and microbiological findings in patients with peri-implantitis: a cross-sectional study.,"The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and microbiological characters in subjects and implants affected and not affected by peri-implantitis. Additionally, same features were analyzed also intra-individually, comparing healthy and diseased implants within the same subject.
A total of 534 patients who received at least 1 implant and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits at the University of Valencia were recruited. Clinical parameters including Bleeding on probing (BoP), Probing pocket depth (PPD), and Pi were screened. Samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three locations: peri-implant sulci (PIS), inner parts of the implant connections (I), and gingival sulci of neighboring teeth (GS). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for total counts of 10 microorganisms.
A total of 534 patients with 1507 dental implants were analyzed. The prevalence of peri-implantitis was found 10.3% for patients and 7.3% for implants. Higher percentage of healthy periodontal subjects were found in the non-peri-implantitis group. The analysis within the 53 patients affected by peri-implantitis revealed that the implants affected by peri-implantitis presented a higher percentage of plaque, BoP, and number of implants presenting <2 mm attached gingiva. Additionally, more cemented crowns and implants inserted in bone-augmented sites were found among the diseased implants. The microbiologic analysis presented no relevant differences between the analysis at the peri-implant sulcus (PIS) and the connections inside the abutments surfaces (PI). The microbial composition at the neighboring teeth (GS) resembled the composition found at the PIS with a high frequency of Pg, Tf, Pi, PM, and Ec.
The results of this study seem to indicate that inadequate oral hygiene and the presence of bleeding from the gingiva/mucosa in patients with dental implant were associated with an higher prevalence of peri-implantitis; moreover, in the patients affected by peri-implantitis, the lack of sufficient height keratinized mucosa (<2 mm) and bone regenerative procedures at implant level were also associated to higher prevalence of peri-implantitis as well."
25459098,Randomized comparison of bleeding patterns in women using a combined contraceptive vaginal ring or a low-dose combined oral contraceptive on a menstrually signaled regimen.,"To compare bleeding patterns for 12 months continuous use of a contraceptive ring [contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR)] and pill [combined oral contraceptive (COC)] on a menstrually signaled regimen and the effectiveness of 4 days ""treatment withdrawal"" to stop bleeding.
Women, 66 to each group, were randomized to continuous use of a CVR (15 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg etonogestrel) or a low-dose pill (20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/100 mcg levonorgestrel) for 360 days on a menstrually signaled regimen. Bleeding/spotting days, daily use of ring or pill, was recorded. Endpoint was the total number of bleeding/spotting days for each method over four 90-day reference periods (RP) plus the analysis of bleeding patterns using modified World Health Organization criteria.
There was a reduction in the mean (±S.D.) number of bleeding/spotting days from RP1 (CVR 14.2±10; pill 16.6±10.9) to RP4 (CVR 8.8±9.6; pill 8.8±9.1). Fifteen percent of CVR and 4% COC users experienced amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding throughout the study. Amenorrhea increased over time (RP1 vs. RP4: CVR 10% vs. 21% and COC 2% vs. 30%). Compliance with the menstrually signaled regimen was poor. Ceasing hormones for 4 days stopped a bleeding episode within 5 days in the majority of episodes and many stopped spontaneously.
Bleeding patterns with continuous use of the CVR and COC are similar and improve over 1 year of use. The unpredictability, but short duration, of bleeding episodes should be stressed during counseling.
This information for clinicians and women about breakthrough bleeding patterns with use of a CVR or combined pill over 12 months using a menstrually signaled regimen will give women an indication of what to expect with continuous use."

25418083,Efficacy of intra-cervical misoprostol in the management of early pregnancy failure.,"The aim of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy of intra-cervical misoprostol in the management of early pregnancy failure. Twenty women with early pregnancy failure received intra-cervical misoprostol via an endometrial sampling cannula. The first dose was 50 μg of misoprostol dissolved in 5 ml of normal saline. The administration was repeated after 12 h if there was no vaginal bleeding or pain. Nine (45%) women received 1 dose and 11 (55%) women received 2 doses of intra-cervical misoprostol. Abortion within 24 h occurred in 16 (80%) women, and complete abortion was achieved in 14 (70%) cases. Two women with incomplete abortion were managed with 600 μg of misoprostol orally (1 case) and surgical intervention (1 case). The mean time interval between the first dose and the abortion was 10.6 ± 6.3 h. Two women did not respond within 24 h of treatment initiation, 1 woman withdrew consent after the first treatment, and 1 woman developed heavy vaginal bleeding after the first dose and underwent surgical management. Intra-cervical misoprostol is a promising method of medical treatment of early pregnancy failure. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to validate its safety and efficacy."
25370961,Gastrointestinal bleedings during therapy with new oral anticoagulants are rarely reported.,"Post-marketing surveillance of drugs relies on spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events to the Danish Health and Medicines Authority. A number of new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have recently been marketed in Denmark. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reporting of serious adverse drug events in patients treated with a NOAC and admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding.
This study is based on an electronic free text search in patient records and a search in the electronic medication records of all patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Surgical Section, Hvidovre Hospital, during a one-year-period. Patients in treatment with NOAC and admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding were identified. Relevant patients were cross-checked for a reported adverse drug event in the Danish Health and Medi-cines Authority's database on adverse medical events.
A total of 20 patients were acutely admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding while in treatment with a NOAC, an adverse medical event was reported for one of these patients (5%; 95% confidence interval: 0-25%).
Serious adverse events in patients treated with NOAC are underreported which questions the current effectiveness of post-marketing surveillance of adverse drug effects.

25361529,A cross-country comparison of rivaroxaban spontaneous adverse event reports and concomitant medicine use with the potential to increase the risk of harm.,"Concerns with the safety profiles of the newer anticoagulants have been raised because of differences in treatment populations between pre-marketing studies (randomized controlled trials) and clinical practice. Little is known about the potential safety issues and the reporting in spontaneous adverse event databases associated with rivaroxaban.
To analyse spontaneous adverse event reports associated with the oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban from Australia, Canada and the USA; and to examine concomitant medicine use that may increase the risk of adverse events.
Spontaneous adverse event report databases from Australia, Canada and the USA were examined for all reports of adverse events associated with rivaroxaban and concomitant medicines from 1 August 2005 to 31 March 2013. Disproportionality analysis (the proportional reporting ratio [PRR] and reporting odds ratio [ROR]) was conducted for quantitative detection of signals, using the US database.
There were 244 spontaneous adverse event reports associated with rivaroxaban from Australia, 536 from Canada and 1,638 from the USA. Reporting of haemorrhage (any type) was common, ranging from 30.7% for Australia to 37.5% for Canada. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage was the most commonly reported haemorrhage, accounting for 13.9% of Australian, 16.4% of Canadian and 11.1% of US adverse event reports. Positive signals were confirmed in the US data (haemorrhage [any type] PRR 11.93, χ (2) 4,414.78 and ROR 13.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.13-14.81; gastrointestinal haemorrhage PRR 12.52, χ (2) 2,018.48 and ROR 13.15, 95% CI 11.36-15.21). Reporting of concomitant use of medicines with the potential to increase bleeding risk ranged from 63.7% in Australia to 89.2% in Canada.
A large proportion of adverse event reports for rivaroxaban were associated with use of concomitant medicines, which may have increased the risk of adverse events-in particular, haemorrhage. Increased awareness of a patient's comorbidity and associated medicine use is needed when rivaroxaban is used in clinical practice."
25353701,Passage of decidual cast following poor compliance with oral contraceptive pill.,"Decidual cast describes the spontaneous sloughing of endometrium as an entire piece while retaining the shape of the endometrial cavity. It may be associated with increased serum progesterone levels and must be considered as a differential diagnosis in a patient who passes tissue per vagina while on progesterone containing hormonal contraception.
A 13-year-old adolescent with a history of menorrhagia since menarche, presented to the pediatric emergency room with worsening abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding stopping her oral contraceptive pill 10 days prior to presentation. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously following passage of tissue per vagina which was later by histopathology to be a decidual cast.
Decidual cast is a rare pathological entity that may be a side effect of progesterone-containing hormonal contraceptives, requiring patient education before use."
25317211,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura presenting as unprovoked gingival hemorrhage: a case report.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease characterized by auto-antibody induced platelet destruction and reduced platelet production, leading to low blood platelet count. In this case report, the clinical diagnose of a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and spontaneous gingival hemorrhage by a dentist is presented. The patient did not have any systemic disease that would cause any spontaneous hemorrhage. The patient was referred to a hematologist urgently and her thrombocyte number was found to be 2000/μL. Other test results were in normal range and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnose was verified. Then hematological treatment was performed and patient's health improved without further problems. Hematologic diseases like immune thrombocytopenic purpura, in some cases may appear firstly in the oral cavity and dentists must be conscious of unexplained gingival hemorrhage. In addition, the dental treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients must be planned with a hematologist."
25241967,Unusual symptomatic inclusion cysts in a newborn: a case report.,"Dental lamina cysts are cysts that occur as white or pink small nodules, often multiple, approximately 1 to 3mm in diameter. They are typically located on the midpalatine raphe and less frequently on the maxillary and mandibular alveolar mucosa; in the latter case these can be appear to be neonatal teeth.On microscopic examination, these lesions show a stratified squamous epithelium (two to three cell layers); it is possible to find protein, keratin and/or exfoliated epithelial cells in the lumen of the lesions.Neonatal cysts usually show no particular symptoms. They are associated with an excellent prognosis because they regress spontaneously within a few weeks and are not associated to any complications. However, if pain, bleeding or other symptoms occur, a surgical excision is required.
In this paper, we present an anomalous case of symptomatic dental lamina cyst which affected a 60-day-old male Caucasian newborn. The surgical treatment was elective in this case and 6-month follow-ups were mandatory.
We can underline the successful predictability of the surgical approach; however, we consider that the treatment choice should take place in the light of medical history and clinical considerations, and always be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Further studies and reviews in this field should be performed in order to suggest guidelines for clinicians, although these cases are rare."
25072863,[Vaginal bleeding as symptom of a medical emergency--pitfalls of therapy with new oral anticoagulants - case 5/2014].,"A 90-year-old female patient treated with dabigatran for atrial fibrillation presented emergently with a spontaneous vaginal bleeding due to endometrium carcinoma.
Laboratory analysis revealed azotemia consistent with acute-on-chronic renal failure. Coagulation was deranged (prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) by 3.5-fold, international normalized ratio (INR) 7.8) due to a massive accumulation of dabigatran (measured plasma concentration 2230 ng/ml).
Vaginal bleedings were treated with external tamponade. Hemodialysis treatment was commenced due to uremia and dabigatran accumulation. Over night, the patient was dialysed with a SLED (sustained low efficiency dialysis) regimen. After volume resuscitation renal function promptly ensued indicating prerenal azotemia as a cause of renal failure. After two more hemodialysis sessions dabigatran concentrations were no longer detecable and this was paralleled by normalization of coagulation tests.
Dabigatran can accumulate massively during acute renal failure and evoke a life-threatening bleeding diathesis. Dabigatran can be removed with low efficient dialysis (such as SLED)."
25032206,Focal epithelial hyperplasia in a human immuno-deficiency virus patient treated with laser surgery.,"Focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH), or Heck's disease, is a rare disease of the oral mucosa; it is mostly found in children or young adults who are immunosuppressed and who live in regions with low socioeconomic status. It is characterized by asymptomatic papules on the oral mucosa, gingiva, tongue, and lips. Healing can be spontaneous, and treatment is indicated if there are aesthetic or functional complications. Human papillomavirus, especially genotypes 13 and 32, has been associated with FEH and is detected in the majority of lesions. Histopathologically, FEH is characterized by parakeratosis, epithelial hyperplasia, focal acanthosis, and fusion and horizontal outgrowth of epithelial ridges. A 37-year-old male patient was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Sciences at the Sapienza University of Rome, complaining of numerous exophytic lesions in his mouth. He stated that the lesions were not painful but he had experienced occasional bleeding after incidental masticatory trauma. He had received no previous treatment for the oral lesions. His medical history revealed that he was human immuno-deficiency virus positive and was a smoker with numerous, asymptomatic oral papules clinically and histologically corresponding to FEH. The labial and buccal mucosa were especially affected by lesions. Surgical treatment was performed using a 532-nm potassium titanyl phosphate laser (SmartLite, Deka, Florence, Italy) in continuous mode with a 300 μm fiber and power of 1.4 W (power density 1980.22 W/cm(2)). After anesthesia without vasoconstrictors, the lesions were tractioned with sutures or an Allis clamp and then completely excised. The lesions were preserved in 10% formalin for histological examination, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of FEH. In this case, the laser allowed excellent control of bleeding, without postoperative sutures, and optimal wound healing."
25030773,Insights into the role of thrombin in the pathogenesis of recurrent ischaemia after acute coronary syndrome.,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a medical emergency. Patients who survive the initial event remain at risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. In most cases, ACS is triggered by thrombosis after rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Key to thrombus formation at this site is the generation of thrombin, which not only converts fibrinogen to fibrin but also serves as a potent platelet agonist and induces platelet aggregation at the site of vascular injury. Although dual antiplatelet therapy is more effective for the prevention of recurrent events than aspirin alone after ACS, there remains an approximately 10 % risk of recurrent ischaemic events at one year. Recent studies have evaluated whether the addition of an anticoagulant to antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of recurrent ischaemia after an ACS event. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, attenuates thrombin generation. When used in conjunction with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with stabilised ACS, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily significantly reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke compared with placebo. Although it increased the risk of bleeding, rivaroxaban was associated with a reduction in mortality; a finding that supports the use of a dual-pathway approach that combines anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. This review explores the pathophysiology of ACS to provide perspective on the results of recent clinical trials with novel oral anticoagulants for ACS and to identify their potential role in this setting."
24909909,Management of Hepatocellular Adenoma: Recent Advances.,"Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a rare benign liver cell neoplasm that occurs more frequently in young women with a history of prolonged use of oral contraceptives. Surgical resection is considered because of the risk of hemorrhage in 25% and of malignant transformation in 5% of patients with HCA. HCA is a heterogeneous disease comprising 3 subtypes with distinct molecular and complication profiles. The inflammatory or telangiectatic subtype is at increased risk for hemorrhage, the β-catenin-activated subtype is at increased risk for malignant transformation, and the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α-inactivated or steatotic subtype is at the least risk for complications. One-third of the patients with HCA have multiple tumors on imaging with no increased risk of complications. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for the diagnosis and subtype characterization of HCA. Systematic resection of HCA is recommended in male patients owing to the higher incidence of malignant transformation, and surgical excision in women should be reserved for tumors 5 cm or larger associated with an increased risk of complications. Cessation of hormonal therapy and radiologic surveillance in women with HCA tumors smaller than 5 cm shows that the vast majority of HCA remain stable or undergo spontaneous regression. Percutaneous core needle biopsy is of limited value because the therapeutic strategy is based primarily on patient sex and tumor size. Transarterial embolization is the initial treatment for HCA complicated by hemorrhage. Pregnancy should not be discouraged in the presence of HCA, however, frequent sonographic surveillance is recommended."
24852230,Advances in understanding spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: insights from neuroimaging.,"Spontaneous (non-traumatic) symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating form of stroke, with very high overall mortality and morbidity. Even with the best current medical or surgical treatment, outcomes still remain poor. By contrast with ischemic stroke, the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is not decreasing. Indeed, the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage related to antithrombotic drugs, including oral anticoagulants, has increased in recent decades. Despite the clear unmet research need for both prevention and acute treatment, there has, until recently, been limited progress in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. New advances, especially related to neuroimaging biomarkers, are rapidly increasing our understanding of the spectrum of mechanisms of brain injury in intracerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this article is to review recent insights from neuroimaging studies into the pathophysiology and causes of intracerebral hemorrhage, focusing on MRI. We also discuss some of the current and future challenges facing clinicians in understanding and treating intracerebral hemorrhage."
24841749,An international comparison of spontaneous adverse event reports and potentially inappropriate medicine use associated with dabigatran.,"The objective of this study was to analyse spontaneous adverse event (SAE) reports associated with the oral anticoagulant dabigatran from Australia, Canada and USA and to examine concomitant medicine use.
Spontaneous adverse event national databases from Australia, Canada and the USA were used to examine all reports of adverse events associated with dabigatran from 1st August 2005 to 31st March 2013. Disproportionality analysis was conducted for the quantitative detection of signals using the USA database. Concomitant medicine use was examined to identify potentially inappropriate medicines, which may place the patient at increased risk for adverse events.
There were a total of 1039, 1333 and 13 788 SAE reports associated with dabigatran from Australia, Canada and USA, respectively. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were the most commonly reported adverse event, ranging from 27.5% for Australia and up to 40.5% for USA. Of these, GI haemorrhage accounted for 81.5% of Australian, 71.5% of Canadian and 42% of the USA adverse event reports for GI disorders. Positive signals were confirmed in the USA data (GI haemorrhage; PRR 18.18, χ2 40993.51 and ROR 19.55 95% CI 18.77-20.36). Use of concomitant medicines with the potential to increase bleeding risk across all three countries ranged from 34.1% for Australia to 51.1% for the USA.
A large proportion of adverse events were associated with concomitant therapies, which may have placed the patient at increased risk of harm. This highlights the need for pharmacovigilance by the prescribing clinician to minimise risk and ensure the safe and effective integration of dabigatran into routine clinical practice."
24762109,"Effects of low-dose estrogen replacement during childhood on pubertal development and gonadotropin concentrations in patients with Turner syndrome: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","The optimal approach to estrogen replacement in girls with Turner syndrome has not been determined.
The aim of the study was to assess the effects of an individualized regimen of low-dose ethinyl estradiol (EE2) during childhood from as early as age 5, followed by a pubertal induction regimen starting after age 12 and escalating to full replacement over 4 years.
This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
The study was conducted at two US pediatric endocrine centers.
Girls with Turner syndrome (n = 149), aged 5.0-12.5 years, were enrolled; data from 123 girls were analyzable for pubertal onset.
Interventions comprised placebo or recombinant GH injections three times a week, with daily oral placebo or oral EE2 during childhood (25 ng/kg/d, ages 5-8 y; 50 ng/kg/d, ages >8-12 y); after age 12, all patients received escalating EE2 starting at a nominal dosage of 100 ng/kg/d. Placebo/EE2 dosages were reduced by 50% for breast development before age 12 years, vaginal bleeding before age 14 years, or undue advance in bone age.
The main outcome measures for this report were median ages at Tanner breast stage ≥2, median age at menarche, and tempo of puberty (Tanner 2 to menarche). Patterns of gonadotropin secretion and impact of childhood EE2 on gonadotropins also were assessed.
Compared with recipients of oral placebo (n = 62), girls who received childhood low-dose EE2 (n = 61) had significantly earlier thelarche (median, 11.6 vs 12.6 y, P < 0.001) and slower tempo of puberty (median, 3.3 vs 2.2 y, P = 0.003); both groups had delayed menarche (median, 15.0 y). Among childhood placebo recipients, girls who had spontaneous breast development before estrogen exposure had significantly lower median FSH values than girls who did not.
In addition to previously reported effects on cognitive measures and GH-mediated height gain, childhood estrogen replacement significantly normalized the onset and tempo of puberty. Childhood low-dose estrogen replacement should be considered for girls with Turner syndrome."

24558941,[Anesthesia in a neonate with capillary hemangioma of the maxilla: a case report].,"A 21-day-old female neonate weighing 3.2 kg was scheduled for surgical excision of a maxillary tumor under general anesthesia. The lesion was present since birth, with gradual enlargement since then. Preoperatively, the lesion measured 25 mm in diameter, although it was not known whether it was benign or malignant. The oral surgeon anticipated that the surgery would require 30 minutes for completion and would involve minimal bleeding. Hence, blood products were not prepared preoperatively. A good intravenous access was secured before induction of general anesthesia, which was achieved with IV thiopental. When it was ascertained that the patient could be easily ventilated by a bag and mask, rocuronium bromide was administered, together with inhalation of sevoflurane. However, the glottis could not be completely visualized on laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation with Cormack and Lehane scores of grade III. Hence, after discussion with the surgeon, we inserted a flexible laryngeal mask for airway management. During the surgery, unexpected massive hemorrhage occurred after incision of the tumor, followed by a severe drop in blood pressure. The amount of blood loss was 100 cc. For this catastrophic hypovolemia, we urgently transfused red cell concentrate (RCC). The surgical procedure lasted for 27 minutes and at the end of the surgery we successfully intubated the patient's trachea with a spiral tube using a guide wire and bronchofiber. After adequate blood transfusion to restore the patient's blood volume, a nasogastric tube was inserted and the patient was extubated in a fully awake state with establishment of adequate spontaneous breathing. Postoperatively, histopathologic examination revealed that the tumor was a jawbone medullary hemangioma."
24516916,The impact of bacterial infections on survival of patients with decompensated cirrhosis.,"INTRODUCTION. Bacterial infection in cirrhotic patients is a severe complication that requires early recognition and specific therapeutic care. MATERIAL AND METHODS. In this review the various aspects of diagnosis and management of infections that may impact survival in cirrhosis are analyzed. RESULTS. Active search for infections allows early detection and its treatment with suitable antibiotics has reduced mortality rates in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the main infection in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Other common infections, such as bacteremia and septicemia or urinary tract, lung, skin and soft tissue infections must be thoroughly investigated so that antibiotic treatment can be started early. As intestinal bacterial translocation is one of the most important mechanisms for development of bacterial infections, selective intestinal decontamination is able to prevent these infections in populations at risk. After the first episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, poorly absorbed oral antibiotics, such as quinolones, must be started and continued. Moreover, when there is upper gastrointestinal bleeding, infection prevention should be based on oral administration of quinolones or intravenous administration of cephalosporins, both for seven days, to avoid morbidity and early lethality. With the advent of resistance to commonly used antibiotics and recent reports of multiresistant bacteria, there is a need for stricter control when administering antibiotics to cirrhotic patients. CONCLUSION. Existing knowledge of therapy and prophylaxis for bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients, which undoubtedly improve survival, should be disseminated and applied in clinical practice for the benefit of the population at large."
24505955,The chorionic bump associated with acrania--case report.,"The chorionic bump is a rare abnormality of the gestational sac, presenting as a convex bulge from the choriodecidual surface into the sac, correlated with poor prognosis for the pregnancy We report a case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman, with a history of spontaneous abortion, who presented for an early scan a 6 weeks and 4 days of gestation. The pregnancy was spontaneous and unplanned. The patient conceived in less than 3 months after discontinuing oral contraceptives. No folic acid was taken before or in the pregnancy An ultrasound scan revealed a chorionic bump with a hypoechoic center and echogenic border, measuring 18.3 x 14.7 x 21.9 mm. No motion within the chorionic bump was detected upon color and power Doppler examination. The second scan was performed a week later at 7+4 wks. The chorionic bump had not changed in terms of size and sonographic appearance. An acranial fetus of CRL 45.5 mm was diagnosed at 11 + 2 wks. The concentration of free beta-hCG was 17.2 IU/L, corresponding to 0.37 MoM and PAPP-A levels were 1.31 IU/L, corresponding to 0.82 MoM. After counseling the patient opted for termination of pregnancy Very few cases of chorionic bumps have been described so far and, to the best of our knowledge, its coexistence with neural tube defects has been reported for the first time. We postulate a possibility of an underlying pathological mechanism for such coexistence. The chorionic bump is a focal convex bulge with irregular borders, protruding from the choriodecidual surface into the gestational sac and with different degrees of echogenicity usually a hypoechoic middle and echogenic border The chorionic bump might represent the following: a hematoma, an area of hemorrhage, a non-embryonic gestation, or a demise of an embryo in a twin pregnancy The presence of the bump is associated with a four-fold increase in the spontaneous abortion rate as compared with the general population. Decreased folate levels increase the incidence of neural tube defects. Oxidative stress resulting from folic acid deficiency may be responsible for neural tube defects through impairment of factors inhibiting apoptosis in the neuroepithelium. Fetuses with neural tube defects are at an increased risk of being aborted spontaneously Furthermore, women who deliver children with neural tube defects frequently have a history of miscarriage. Our patient did not take any folic acid and also had a history of spontaneous miscarriage. In the case we herein presented, the coexistence of acrania and placental pathology could be attributed to folate deficiency Such coexistence is described for the first time and could be accidental, but there is possible theoretical association between these two pathologies."
24433988,"[Misoprostol: off-label use in the first trimester of pregnancy (spontaneous abortion, and voluntary medical termination of pregnancy)].","State of knowledge about misoprostol's use out of its marketing authorization during the first trimester of pregnancy, in early miscarriage or to induce abortion or medical termination of pregnancy.
French and English publications were searched using PubMed, Cochrane Library and international learned societies recommendations.
Cervical ripening prior to surgical uterine evacuation during the first trimester of pregnancy facilitates cervical dilatation and reduces operative time and uterine retention risk. Misoprostol, mifepristone and osmotic cervical dilators are equally efficient. Concerning first trimester miscarriage, surgical uterine evacuation remains the most effective and the quickest method of treatment (EL 1). Depending on the clinical situation, medical treatment using misoprostol (missed miscarriage) or expectative attitude (incomplete miscarriage) does not increase the risk of complications, neither haemorrhagic nor infectious (EL 1). However, these alternatives generally require longer outpatient follow-up, which leads to more consultations, prolonged bleeding and not planned surgical procedures (EL 1). Concerning missed miscarriage, a vaginal dose of 800 μg of misoprostol, possibly repeated 24 to 48 hours later, seems to offer the best efficiency/tolerance ratio (EL 2). Concerning early abortion, medical method is a safe and efficient alternative to surgery (EL 2). Success rates are inversely proportional to gestational age (EL 2). According to the modalities of its marketing authorization, 400 μg of misoprostol can only be given by oral route, for less than 7 weeks of amenorrhea (WA) pregnancies and after 36 to 48 hours following 600 mg of mifepristone (EL 1). However, 200mg of mifepristone is as efficient as 600 mg (EL 1). Beyond 7WA, misoprostol buccal dissolution (sublingual or prejugal) or vaginal administration are more efficient and better tolerated than oral ingestion (EL 1). Between 7 and 9WA, the best protocol in terms of efficiency and tolerance is the association of 200mg of mifepristone followed 24 to 48 hours later by 800 μg of vaginal, sublingual or buccal misoprostol (EL 1). An additional dose of 400 μg can be given 3 hours later if necessary (EL 3). In case of buccal administration, the dose of 400 μg seems to offer the same efficiency with a better tolerance but further evaluation is needed (EL 2). Between 9 and 12WA, medical treatment is less efficient than surgery and its tolerance is lower (EL 2). However, a protocol of 200mg of mifepristone followed 36 to 48 hours later by 800 μg of vaginal or sublingual misoprostol, plus an additional 400 μg dose every 3-4 hours (until 4-5 doses maximum) seems safe and efficient (EL 5).
Misoprostol use during the first trimester of pregnancy is a safe and efficient alternative to surgery as long as detailed protocols adjusted to each clinical situation are respected."
24426326,An Audit of Management of Patients on Oral Anticoagulant Therapy With International Normalized Ratio (INR) Five or Above.,"Maintaining the international normalized ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range in patients on oral anticoagulant treatment is a challenge for the physician. Excessive anticoagulation poses the risk of bleeding in patients. Management strategies vary among clinicians although standard guidelines exist for the same. We conducted an audit in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy in our hospital with excessive anticoagulation. This retrospective study was carried out among patients on oral anticoagulant therapy for various thrombotic conditions with at least a single INR recording of 5 or more. Other than demographic details, the type of oral anticoagulant used, indication, duration of treatment, dosage and concomitant use of interacting drugs or alcohol were also recorded. Detail of the nature and site of bleed and management for the same was also noted. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Fifty episodes with INR ≥ 5 (5.0-10.75) were noted in 44 patients (M:F = 1:1). Their age ranged from 20 to 88 years (mean 50.3 ± 16.4 years). The duration of anticoagulant therapy varied from 3 days to 180 months. Of the 43 episodes in patients who had no bleeding, the anticoagulant was stopped on 32 occasions for variable periods with dose reduction in the rest of the patients. Spontaneous bleeding was seen in seven patients (6 major and 1 minor). Among the seven patients with bleeding, other than stopping he oral anticoagulant drug, other measures taken were vitamin K therapy, fresh frozen plasma or packed red cell transfusion. Overall management strategy of patients with high INR was in compliance with standard recommendations."
15899352,StatPearls,"Labor is the process through which a fetus and placenta are delivered from the uterus through the vagina. Human labor divides into three stages. The first stage is further divided into two phases. Successful labor involves three factors: maternal efforts and uterine contractions, fetal characteristics, and pelvic anatomy. This triad is classically referred to as the passenger, power, and passage. Clinicians typically use multiple modalities to monitor labor. Serial cervical examinations are used to determine cervical dilation, effacement, and fetal position, also known as the station. Fetal heart monitoring is employed nearly continuously to assess fetal well-being throughout labor. Cardiotocography is used to monitor the frequency and adequacy of contractions. Medical professionals use the information they obtain from monitoring and cervical exams to determine the patient's stage of labor and monitor labor progression. "
33161246,GeneReviews,"Lipoid proteinosis (LP) is characterized by deposition of hyaline-like material in various tissues resulting in a hoarse voice from early infancy, vesicles and hemorrhagic crusts in the mouth and on the face and extremities, verrucous and keratotic cutaneous lesions on extensor surfaces (especially the elbows), and moniliform blepharosis (multiple beaded papules along the eyelid margins and inner canthus). Extracutaneous manifestations may include epilepsy, neuropsychiatric disorders, spontaneous CNS hemorrhage, and asymptomatic multiple yellowish nodules throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, the disease course is chronic and fluctuating. Males and females are affected equally. Affected individuals have a normal life span unless they experience laryngeal obstruction.

24349391,Pulsed estrogen therapy prevents post-OVX porcine dura mater microvascular network weakening via a PDGF-BB-dependent mechanism.,"In postmenopausal women, estrogen (E2) deficiencies are frequently associated with higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage, increased incidence of stroke, cerebral aneurysm, and decline in cognitive abilities. In younger postpartum women and those using oral contraceptives, perturbations in E2 are associated with higher risk of cerebral venous thrombosis. A number of serious intracranial pathologic conditions linked to E2 deficiencies, such as dural sinus thrombosis, dural fistulae, non-parenchymal intracranial hemorrhages, migraines, and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks, involve the vessels not of the brain itself, but of the outer fibrous membrane of the brain, the dura mater (DM). The pathogenesis of these disorders remains mysterious and how estrogen regulates structural and functional integrity of DM vasculature is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that post ovariectomy (OVX) DM vascular remodeling is manifested by microvessel destabilization, capillary rarefaction, increased vascular permeability, and aberrant angio-architecture, and is the result of disrupted E2-regulated PDGF-BB signaling within dura microvasculature. These changes, associated with the reduction in systemic PDGF-BB levels, are not corrected by a flat-dose E2 hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but are largely prevented using HRT schedules mimicking physiological E2 fluctuations. We demonstrate that 1) E2 regulates PDGF-BB production by endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner and 2) optimization of PDGF-BB levels and induction of robust PDGF-mediated endothelial cell-vascular pericyte interactions require high (estrous) E2 concentrations. We conclude that high (estrous) levels of E2 are important in controlling PDGF-mediated crosstalk between endothelial cells and pericytes, a fundamental mechanism governing microvessel stability and essential for preserving intracranial homeostasis."
24282421,Metronomic capecitabine in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma unresponsive to or ineligible for sorafenib treatment: report of two cases.,"Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, is the only systemic agent proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are no approved second line systemic therapies in patients who have had disease progression on or are not eligible to sorafenib.
We describe two cases of unresectable HCC that were treated with low, ""metronomic"" doses of capecitabine. In the first patient, capecitabine was used after sorafenib failure. In the second case, treatment with capecitabine was attempted since the patient was considered not eligible for sorafenib due to spontaneous hepatic bleeding of a large HCC lesion. Treatment was effective and well tolerated in both patients with long-lasting objective responses.
Lacking established second-line therapy, metronomic capecitabine may be a valid alternative in the treatment of HCC patients who are judged not eligible for sorafenib or those having progression disease on sorafenib."
24232947,Hemorrhagic choroidal detachment after use of anti-glaucomatous eye drops: case report.,"Eighty-two-year-old patient with a pacemaker using warfarin due to arrhythmia and having an intraocular lens in the right eye, developed spontaneous hemorrhagic choroidal detachment one day after the use of combined preparation of 0.5% timolol maleate and 0.004% travoprost, due to primary open-angle glaucoma. Hemorrhagic detachment was detected by anterior and posterior segment examination, as well as B-scan ultrasonography. After the detachment, excessive increased intraocular pressure was controlled with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, cycloplegic and steroid therapy. After four months, visual acuity was 20/20 and the intraocular pressure was under control with 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% brinzolamide. Controlled reduction of the intraocular pressure should be considered, particularly in older patients under anticoagulant therapy and that had undergone prior ocular surgery."
24063522,Spontaneous subperiosteal hematoma precipitated by anxiety attack.,"A 60-year-old woman presented with diplopia and left periorbital edema and pressure, which developed during an anxiety attack the previous day. Examination revealed left inferotemporal globe dystopia, periorbital edema, ecchymosis, and limitation in supraduction. Orbital MRI confirmed the diagnosis of a superior subperiosteal orbital hematoma. The patient's signs and symptoms rapidly resolved with administration of oral corticosteroids. The patient remains asymptomatic with complete resolution of orbital signs at 3-month follow-up. Subperiosteal orbital hematoma (SOH) is a rare condition in which blood accumulates between the bony orbit and separated periosteum, and is often due to blunt head trauma. Non-traumatic SOH (NTSOH) is exceedingly rare and usually associated with known coagulopathies or tendency to bleed. However, few cases of spontaneous NTSOH have been reported without any such predisposition and are thought to be caused by sudden elevations in intrathoracic and intracranial venous pressure such as vomiting, coughing, SCUBA diving, weight lifting and labor. We herein describe the presentation, radiography and outcome of a unique case of spontaneous NTSOH following an anxiety attack."
23921838,Epsilon aminocaproic acid prevents bleeding in severely thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.,"Despite prophylactic platelet transfusions, bleeding remains a significant problem in thrombocytopenic patients.
The antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) was administered to 44 chronically (median duration, 273 days) and severely (platelet count, 8 × 10(9)/L; range, 1 × 10(9)/L-19 × 10(9)/L) thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies. Prophylactic EACA at a dose of 1 g twice daily was orally administered for a median duration of 47 days (range, 7 days-209 days) until the platelet count recovered to > 30; × 10(9) /L. Platelets were only transfused if bleeding occurred.
While receiving EACA, 59% of the patients did not bleed, 25% had 19 episodes of spontaneously resolving minor bleeding that did not require platelet transfusion, and 16% received a median of 4 platelet transfusions (range, 1 transfusion-8 transfusions) for 1 major traumatic and 9 spontaneous grade 2 to grade 3 bleeding (based on the World Health Organization classification of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). No EACA toxicities were noted, and venous thromboses were not observed.
EACA is well tolerated and is associated with a low risk of major bleeding in patients with hematological malignancies who are experiencing chronic severe thrombocytopenia."
23908961,Intramural hematomas of the gastrointestinal system: a 5-year single center experience.,"Although spontaneous intramural hematomas of the gastrointestinal tract are very rare, they may be observed with the use of oral anticoagulant, though less frequently in cases of hematological malignancy and other bleeding disorders. Cases diagnosed as spontaneous intramural hematoma have been assessed in our clinic.
The cases, which were diagnosed as spontaneous intramural hematoma in the gastrointestinal tract (SIHGT) following anamnesis, physical examination, biochemical, radiological and endoscopic findings from July 2008 to July 2012, have been assessed retrospectively.
Seven out of 13 cases were women and the mean age was 65.1 years (34 to 82 years). The most frequent complaint on admission was abdominal pain. The most frequent location of SIHGT was the ileum (n = 8). Oral anticoagulant use was the most common cause of etiology (n = 12). In 10 cases, International normalized ratio values were higher than treatment range (2 to 3, where mechanical valve replacement was 2.5 to 3.5) and mean value was 7.6 (1.70 to 23.13). While 12 cases were discharged without problems with medical treatment, one case with acute myeloid leukemia died in the intensive care unit following cerebrovascular attack.
Spontaneus bleeding and hematomas that may arise in connection with bleeding diathesis may be fatal in cases with long-term oral anticoagulant treatment and insufficient follow-up. In management of these cases, it may be necessary to arrange conservative follow up and/or initialize low molecular weight heparin, and administer vitamin K as well as replace blood products and coagulation factors when indicated."
23906054,Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is an effective preventive therapy for ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). The management of anticoagulation in AF patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of AF after acute ICH in a consecutive monocenter cohort, and to document the subsequent management with respect to OAC.
Consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH were prospectively included within 19 months. Diagnosis of AF was based on medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), 24-h and continuous ECG monitoring. CHADS₂ scores and patient medication were recorded at admission and after 3 months. Additionally, after 3 months mortality, the management of anticoagulation and a newly detected AF were assessed.
In total, 206 ICH patients were eligible for data analysis. After 3 months, AF had been diagnosed in 64/206 ICH patients (31.1%). Mortality after 3 months was higher in patients with AF in univariate analysis (45.3% vs. 31.0%). After adjusting for comorbidities and OAC use, AF did not remain an independent predictor for mortality. In total, 35 patients with AF survived 3 months. Of these, CHADS₂ score was 2 (2/3, median, interquartile range (IQR)) and 27/35 patients had an indication for OAC with respect to the CHADS₂ score, but only 25.7% had been (re-)started on OAC. No consistent factors for deciding whether to initiate OAC treatment could be identified.
Atrial fibrillation is a frequent comorbidity in patients suffering an ICH. Our findings underline the prevailing uncertainty regarding the anticoagulation management of AF after ICH."

The purpose of the paper is to present the specific characteristics of this case, to review the literature that concentrates on spontaneous bleedings and to show the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography as a useful, non invasive imaging method in excluding active hemorrhage and its value in the non-surgical management of the case."
23645221,Intracerebral hemorrhage during anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists: a consecutive observational study.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most devastating complication of oral anticoagulation (OAC). As the number of patients on long-term OAC is expected to rise, the proportion of intracerebral hemorrhage related to OAC (OAC-ICH) in relation to spontaneous ICH (spont-ICH) is expected to increase as well. We determined the proportion of OAC-ICH in consecutive stroke patients and explored differences between OAC-ICH and spont-ICH regarding initial volume, hematoma expansion and outcome. Our prospective study consecutively enrolled patients with supra- and infratentorial ICH. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale Score and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at baseline and after 3 months, medical history and demographic variables were recorded. All admission and follow-up CTs/MRIs were analysed regarding ICH volume using the ABC/2-method. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was quantified using the Graeb score. Within 19 months, 2,282 patients were admitted to our ER. 206 ICH patients were included. Overall, 24.8 % of all ICH were related to OAC. Compared to patients with spont-ICH, OAC-ICH patients were older (p = 0.001), more frequently had initial extension of ICH into the ventricles (p = 0.05) or isolated primary IVH (p = 0.03) and a higher Graeb score upon admission (p = 0.01). In contrast, initial ICH volume (p = 0.16) and ICH expansion (p = 0.9) in those receiving follow-up imaging (n = 152) did not differ between the two groups. After correction for age, there was a trend towards poorer outcome in OAC-ICH (p = 0.08). One-fourth of all ICH are related to OAC. Initial extension of ICH into the ventricles and primary IVH are more frequent in OAC-ICH. The rate of hematoma expansion in OAC-ICH patients is similar to non-anticoagulated ICH patients."
23108264,Oral anticoagulation and the risk of vitreous hemorrhage and retinal tears in eyes with acute posterior vitreous detachment.,"To determine if oral anticoagulation alters the association between vitreous hemorrhage (VH) and retinal tears in eyes with acute, posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
In this retrospective chart review, the complete records of consecutive patients with spontaneous, symptomatic acute PVD from a single referral-based practice were reviewed. The use of oral anticoagulants, the presence of a VH, and the presence of a retinal tear or detachment were recorded.
A total of 336 consecutive eligible patients (336 eyes) were included in the final analysis. Vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 118 (35%) eyes; in 43% of patients taking aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin versus 31% not taking these medications (P = 0.03). Retinal tears occurred in 46% of patients with VH versus 27% of patients without VH (P = 0.0007). Retinal tears occurred in 39% of patients with VH taking aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin compared with 52% of patients not taking these medications. (P = 0.20) A decreased proportion of patients with acute PVD taking one or more of the oral anticoagulant medications studied, regardless of the presence of VH, were diagnosed with a retinal tear (P = 0.0017) or retinal detachment (P = 0.0001).
Retinal tears are commonly found (46%) in the eyes of patients who present with symptoms and signs of acute PVD and VH. Patients taking aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin who develop an acute PVD are more likely to present with VH. No statistically significant association was demonstrated between the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute PVD and VH and the presence of retinal tears or retinal detachment."
22983024,The etiology of small and fresh rectal bleeding in not-sick neonates: should we initially suspect food protein-induced proctocolitis?,"This study was performed to identify the cause and frequency of food protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIPC) in not-sick neonates with small and fresh rectal bleeding and to verify the effectiveness of oral food elimination and challenge test (ECT) as a diagnostic method of FPIPC. We prospectively analyzed neonates with small and fresh rectal bleeding who were clinically normal. We investigated age at symptom onset, feeding at onset of bleeding, the time of bleeding disappearance, stool smear and culture, endoscopic findings, and histopathologies in the biopsy specimens of 16 not-sick neonates. We performed food ECT in cases with over 4 days of persistent rectal bleeding in the absence of any other etiology. In 16 not-sick neonates with rectal bleeding, the median age at symptom onset was 8.5 (1-43) days. Endoscopic abnormalities were observed in all 16 patients, and in 10 cases satisfying the pathological guidelines for FPIPC, two (12.5 %) were confirmed as FPIPC by food ECT. In the other 14 (87.5 %) cases, rectal bleeding spontaneously disappeared after on average at 4 (1-8) days and thus was diagnosed as idiopathic neonatal transient colitis (INTC).
FPIPC is rare as a cause of small and fresh rectal bleeding in not-sick newborns and most of cases proved to be INTC. Although clinical findings are suspected as its symptoms and histological results satisfy its diagnostic criteria, FPIPC should be carefully confirmed through food ECT."
22939328,Case report of spontaneous hemorrhage in a sublingual arteriovenous malformation causing an emergent airway obstruction.,"The literature is devoid of articles on spontaneous orofacial hemorrhage with hematoma formation without an underlying condition. Rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is possibly the rarest form of spontaneous hemorrhage and life-threatening hematoma formation. This pathology is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system, but it can appear in any location. AVM is not generally thought to be an inherited disorder, except in the context of a specific hereditary syndrome. AVMs can be seen using computerized tomographic angiography, but distraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment decision making. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment; however, endovascular embolization has become an important adjunct to surgical intervention. With shrinkage of the lesion or definitive treatment with coils, particles, or glue. Other important considerations in the choice of treatment are the patient's age, lesion size and location, and prior history of hemorrhage."
22819527,Carotid artery rupture and cervicofacial actinomycosis.,"Cervicofacial actinomycosis is an uncommon, progressive infection caused by bacilli of the Actinomyces genus. Actinomyces are common commensal saprophytes in the oral cavity which may have medical importance as facultative pathogens. Subsequent to local injuries to the oral mucosa, they may penetrate the deep tissues and be responsible for suppurative or granulomatous infections. We herein report a case of a 65-year-old man who underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a tonsillar carcinoma. An ulcerous lesion in the base of the tongue developed and spread to the carotid artery wall. The man died of a massive hemorrhage due to left carotid artery rupture. Postmortem computed tomography angiography performed prior to autopsy allowed the precise localization of the source of bleeding to be detected. Postmortem biochemical investigations confirmed the presence of inflammation associated with local bacterial infection. Histological investigations revealed the rupture of the left carotid artery surrounded by numerous colonies of Actinomyces. Acute and chronic inflammation with tissue necrosis as well as post-actinic, fibrotic changes were also found in the tissues surrounding the ruptured artery wall."
22782297,New direct oral anticoagulants--current therapeutic options and treatment recommendations for bleeding complications.,"To date, clinical studies show that the incidence of spontaneous bleeding with new direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) is comparable to that of established anticoagulants. However, unlike vitamin K antagonists, there are currently no clinically available antidotes or approved reversal agents for new DOAs. Restoring normal coagulation is important in many cases, such as emergency surgeries, serious bleedings, or anticoagulant overdosing. Attempts have been made to restore normal coagulation after treatment with new DOAs using compounds such as recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or FEIBA (factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity). Limited pre-clinical data and even less clinical evidence are available on the usefulness of these methods in restoring normal coagulation for the emergency management of critical bleeding episodes. Evaluating the utility of DOAs is further complicated by the fact that it is unknown how predictive established test systems are of the bleeding risks. Clinical practice requires further evaluation of the emergency management options for the new DOAs to define the agents and the doses that are most useful. Furthermore, patients receiving long-term treatment with a DOA are likely to undergo elective surgery at some point, and there is lack of evidence regarding perioperative treatment regimens under such conditions. This review summarises potential bleeding management options and available data on the new DOAs."
24765455,"Treatment of 817 patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage: characteristics, predictive factors and outcome.","The aim of this study was to present the data of a large cohort of patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), who were treated in our department and give a current overview considering special clinical characteristics, performed therapy and different predictive factors for morbidity and mortality. We reviewed the data of all patients with spontaneous ICH, who were treated in our department in a time span of 11 years through an analysis of our prospective database. Patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH were included in the study. Patients with hemorrhage associated to vascular malformation or to cerebral ischemic stroke were excluded. The clinical performance at time of admission and discharge were scored using the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) respectively. The patients' cohort was divided into surgically and conservatively treated groups. Statistical analysis [Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and χ(2)-test] was done for various parameters to analyze their impact on morbidity and mortality. In total, we analyzed the data of 817 patients (364 female and 453 male). Two hundred and sixty-nine patients (32%) were treated conservatively and 556 patients (68%) underwent surgical procedures, i.e. cerebrospinal fluid drainage in 110 (19.8%), craniotomy in 338 (60.7%) and application of both methods in 108 patients (19.4%). Total mortality rate was estimated with 23.5%. GCS<8, age over 70 years, intraventricular and basal ganglia hemorrhage, coumadin medication, combination of co-morbidities, hypertensive hemorrhage and postoperative re-bleeding were statistically significant risk factors for worse outcome (GOS 1 and 2) in the operated group. Similar to the observations of the operated group, GCS<8, age over 70 years and coumadin medication were statistically significant for worse outcome in the conservative group. In contrast, lobar plus basal ganglia ICH and multi-lobar hemorrhages were the most significant factors for worse outcome in the conservative group. The results of our study show that ICH remains a multifarious disease and challenges neurosurgeons repeatedly. Selection of the treatment modality and prediction for neurofunc-tional outcome underlies various parameters. Treatment recommendations of ICH remain an unsolved issue. The consideration of the GCS grade at admission is the most important predictive factor. Old age is not an absolute contraindication for surgery, but cumulative multi-morbidity, especially cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases and oral anticoagulant therapy should be regarded critically in view of surgical treatment."
22554372,[A rare complication of oral anticoagulant treatment: hemothorax].,"Although bleeding is the most serious complication of oral anticoagulant treatment, hemothorax is extremely rare. Herein, a case with localized pleural plaques and spontaneous hemothorax due to warfarin treatment which was improved with medical treatment is presented because of its rarity. The patients recieving oral anticoagulant treatment should be monitorized for effective anticoagulation and adverse effects, if pleural effusion occurs, hemothorax should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis. Pleural pathologies such as pleural plaques or thickening may be risk factors for hemothorax."
22529501,"Histological study of smoke extract of Tobacco nicotiana on the heart, liver, lungs, kidney, and testes of male Sprague-Dawley rats.","Some of the effects of tobacco on man's health are well documented in many scientific reports. Whenever tobacco is used either in smoked or chewed form, nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and oral cavity and is spontaneously moved into the bloodstream where it is circulated throughout the body system.
Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this investigation. The animals were randomly assigned into two groups, A and B, of five animals each. The animals in group B (treatment group) were exposed to smoke from a completely burnt 0.74 g leaf extract of Tobacco nicotiana, wrapped in 0.5 g of sterilized cotton wool for 5 minutes three times daily (7 am, 10 am, and 1 pm). The animals in group A (control group) were exposed to smoke from completely burnt 1.24 g of sterilized cotton wool with the same parameters as observed with the treatment groups. The duration of exposure was 5 days. Three hours after the last exposure, all the animals were killed by cervical dislocation. The heart, liver, lungs, kidney, and testes were carefully excised, blotted dry, and fixed in formol saline for histological analysis using Hematoxylin and Eosin stain.
Using the light microscope, it was observed that the histoarchitectural profiles of the studied organs in the sections obtained from the control animals were well preserved. Histopathological observations of the heart, liver, lungs, kidney, and testes in the treated animals showed a varying pattern of histological alterations, and distortions such as mild edema and occasional destruction of myocardial fibers, degeneration of the hepatocytes, reduction in the population of the germ cells, enlargement of the alveoli, alveolar hemorrhage, shrinkage of the glomerulus and glomerular hemorrhage were observed in the sections of the organs of the study of the animals in the treatment group when compared with the control group, hence showing that the smoke extract of Tobacco nicotiana has adverse and compromising effects on the heart, liver, lungs, kidney, and testes of male Sprague-Dawley rats.
From these observations, it can be inferred that the exposure of male Sprague-Dawley rats to the smoke extract of Tobacco nicotiana may be associated with structural damage of some vital organs."
22408069,"Toxicological effects of a mixture used in weight loss products: p-synephrine associated with ephedrine, salicin, and caffeine.","p-Synephrine is an adrenergic amine found in Citrus aurantium L. fruits and has been used for weight loss in dietary supplements. There are commercial products containing this substance associated to caffeine, salicin, and ephedrine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of this mixture in mice of both sexes. The significative results observed after acute oral administration to male and female mice of 300, 350, and 400 mg/kg total of p-synephrine, ephedrine, salicin, plus caffeine in a 10:4:6:80 w/w ratio included a reduction in locomotor activity and ptosis in all treated groups for both sexes. Seizures were also observed in male (400 mg/kg) and female groups (350 and 400 mg/kg). Gasping and tearing were observed in males. Salivation (400 mg/kg), agitation (350 and 400 mg/kg), and piloerection (all treated groups) were significantly observed only in females. Deaths occurred in males at 350 and 400 mg/kg treated groups and the necropsy showed cardiopulmonary hemorrhage. A reduction in locomotor activity was confirmed through the spontaneous locomotor activity test, in which the number of crossings considerably decreased (P < .01) in all treated groups. The rotarod test showed a decrease in motor coordination at 400 mg/kg. Body temperature decreased significantly (P < .01) in all treated groups compared to controls. The results suggested clear signs of toxicity of p-synephrine, ephedrine, salicin, and caffeine association; this toxicity augments the attentiveness on commercial products containing this mixture, given the expressive number of adverse events related to its utilization."
22381604,Immediate versus delayed medical treatment for first-trimester miscarriage: a randomized trial.,"To compare immediate vs delayed medical treatment for first-trimester miscarriage.
Randomized open-label trial in a university hospital gynecologic emergency department. Between April 2003 and April 2006, 182 women diagnosed with spontaneous abortion before 14 weeks' gestation were assigned to immediate medical treatment (oral mifepristone, followed 48 hours later by vaginal misoprostol, n = 91) or sequential management (1 week of watchful waiting followed, if necessary, by the above-described medical treatment, n = 91). Vacuum aspiration was performed in case of treatment failure, hemorrhage, pain, infection, or patient request.
Compared with immediate medical treatment, sequential management resulted in twice as many vacuum aspirations overall (43.5% vs 19.1%; P < .001), 4 times as many emergent vacuum aspirations (20% vs 4.5%; P = .001), and twice as many unplanned visits to the emergency department (34.1% vs 16.9%; P = .009).
Delaying medical treatment of first-trimester miscarriage increases the rate of unplanned surgical uterine evacuation."
22226814,Orodental manifestations of facial port-wine stains.,"Patients with facial port-wine stains (PWS) often demonstrate oral manifestations of their disorder; however, the spectrum and prevalence of such findings among a cohort of patients with PWS has not been established. As a result, dermatologists and oral health specialists may be uncertain how to counsel their patients with PWS regarding oral hypervascularity, bony oral changes, and oral hygiene.
We sought to identify physical findings and complications involving the teeth, oral cavity, and perioral structures in individuals with facial PWS.
This was a cross-sectional study of 30 patients with facial PWS. Descriptive data were collected through anonymous paired surveys completed by patients and their dentists, and analyzed (Fisher exact test) for trends based on physical findings and stage of the PWS.
The most common orodental manifestations according to patients were enlargement of the lip (53.3%), stained gums (46.7%), abnormal bite (30%), and spontaneous bleeding of the gums (26.7%). Staining of the gingiva correlated significantly with gingival hyperplasia (P = .006), maxillary hyperplasia (P = .014), and widened interdental spaces (P = .002), and in all cases gingival staining predated these findings. Lip hyperplasia was reported more frequently by patients than by their dentists (50% vs 18.2%, P = .008). Orodental manifestations were more common among patients with darker and thicker PWS. Hemorrhage after dental procedures was rare (4.5%).
Modest sample size and difficulty recruiting control subjects are limitations.
Facial PWS commonly affect the orodental structures, and intraoral staining may predict future complications."
22196949,Spontaneous splenic hemorrhage after initiation of dabigatran (Pradaxa) for atrial fibrillation.,"Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT) is an oral anticoagulant that produces a reliable, dose-dependent anticoagulant effect without the need for routine laboratory monitoring. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor, acting like other members in its class (bivalirudin, argatroban) to impede the clotting process through selective and reversible binding with both free and clot-bound thrombin. Dabigatran anticoagulates rapidly: plasma levels peak 2 hours after absorption, with a half-life that ranges between 12 and 17 hours. Dabigatran was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2010 after it compared favorably with warfarin in a large clinical trial studying its efficacy in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Currently, there is no laboratory test on the market by which a physician can quantify the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, nor is there any antidote to reverse a life-threatening bleed should it occur. We present a case of a patient with splenic hemorrhagic soon after initiation of dabigatran."
22005376,Mixed heterotopic gastrointestinal cyst and extranasal glial tissue of oral cavity with cleft palate.,"Mixed choristomas of the oral cavity are uncommon lesions that show a variety of clinical presentations, histological appearance and growth patterns. Mixed choristoma with cleft palate is a very rare developmental malformation. We report an unusual case of mixed choristoma in posterior tongue and left submandibular region in a 6-month-old male baby who had cleft palate. The patient presented with spontaneous bleeding from mouth and recurrent swelling in submandibular region. The histology of the surgical resected specimens displayed features of heterotopic oral gastrointestinal cyst and glial choristoma. The swelling recurred 1 year after surgery; the histology of the second surgical resected specimen displayed scattered islands glial tissue."
21893981,Recurrent stroke after lobar and deep intracerebral hemorrhage: a hospital-based cohort study.,"Recurrent stroke rates after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) vary widely between observational studies due to differences in ICH etiology and risk for thromboembolic events. We therefore aimed to assess the patient characteristics and prognosis after deep and lobar ICH in a well-characterized, multicenter, hospital-based cohort.
Patients were prospectively documented in 13 German neurological stroke centers. Of 744 patients with spontaneous ICH discharged alive, 516 (69.4%) gave informed consent and 496 (66.7%) could be followed up by central telephone interview over a mean duration of 2 years.
In patients with deep ICH, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for stroke during the first year was 5.8% (95% CI 2.9-8.7) and the overall annual rate (calculated over a 3-year period) was 2.9% (95% CI 1.6-4.1). In patients with lobar ICH, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for stroke during the first year was 7.8% (95% CI 3.1-12.5) and the overall annual rate was 7.2% (95% CI 3.8-10.6). At the last follow-up before recurrent stroke or end of study, 141 patients (28.4%) overall received antiplatelet agents, and 12 (2.4%) received oral anticoagulation. No difference could be found for recurrent ICH under antiplatelet agents versus no antithrombotic medication.
The risk of recurrent stroke after lobar ICH remains high beyond the first year, whereas it decreases after 1 year in patients with deep ICH. Antiplatelets are prescribed in a considerable number of patients even though the risk-benefit ratio after ICH remains unknown."
21883447,New anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation.,"Oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation is obligatory to lower the risk of spontaneous cerebrovascular and systemic thromboembolism. For this purpose, vitamin K antagonists (coumarins) have been recommended as the most effective drugs for a long time. However, problems with the practical use of these agents, e.g. the need for frequent and regular coagulation controls, the inter-individual differences in maintaining a stable therapeutic range, as well as drug or food interactions, have led to the search and investigation of alternative compounds characterized by a more simple use (e.g. without regular controls of therapeutic levels), high efficacy, as well as low risk of bleeding. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have recently been investigated to prove whether they fulfill the high expectancy of an ideal anticoagulant with respect to a more favorable efficacy/safety profile and without the need for coagulation controls, thereby improving quality of life. Dabigatran (RE-LY) achieved an impressive reduction in stroke and non-central nervous system (non-CNS) embolism (110 mg: 1.5%/year; 150 mg: 1.1%/year) in contrast to warfarin (1.7%/year; P = 0.34 and P < 0.001) with a favorable action on bleeding hazards. The results of rivaroxaban which were obtained in the ROCKET AF study (on treatment analysis: stroke and non-CNS embolism: 1.7%/year vs. 2.15%/year with warfarin; P = 0.015; primary safety endpoint major and minor bleeding: 14.91 vs. 14.52%; P = 0.442) point in the same direction. And finally, compared to aspirin, apixaban reduced the combined primary efficacy endpoint by 52% with comparable rates of bleeding (AVERROES). This review gives a summary of the current knowledge about these agents and their potential future importance."
21439866,Dental treatment of a patient with an implanted left ventricular assist device: expanding the frontiers.,"The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is used as a bridge to heart transplantation. Currently, these devices are being used for longer periods of time than in previous years for the purpose of bridge to life, thus the need for dental assistance will emerge.
A female with severe acute congestive heart failure, owing to dilated cardiomyopathy, needed implantation of an LVAD as a bridge to heart transplantation. Six months after insertion of the device she suffered from spontaneous gingival bleeding and sought dental treatment. She presented with several dento-medical problems that required resolution before commencement of dental treatment.
Management of a patient with LVAD opens new frontiers for the dental team regarding treatment of the medically severely compromised patient who may present with multiple intervening medical aspects: profound antithrombotic therapy, high risk of device infection, possible magnetic interference with dental instruments, and even assessment of vital signs."
21400007,Spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage associated with prolonged diosmin therapy.,"The prevalent use of anticoagulation in a growing elderly population has led to an increasing incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Furthermore, the understanding of the interactions and adverse effects of oral anticoagulants when used with non-FDA approved drugs is limited. Diosmin is one such non-FDA approved drug which is a semisynthetic, phlebotropic supplement with multiple microcirculatory effects. We report a case of a patient on oral anticoagulation and diosmin, who presented with spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage, and discuss the possible etiology behind this rare event.
A retrospective chart review and a comprehensive search of the literature using the PubMed database were performed.
A 77-year old female with a 6 week history of warfarin therapy and a several year history of diosmin use presented with severe bitemporal headache. Computed tomography scan revealed an acute hemorrhage within the right ventricle without associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage. International normalized ratio measured 1.8 and was corrected using fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. She was discharged without neurological deficits.
Diosmin inhibits platelet aggregation and prolongs the effect of norepinephrine on venous tone, leading to increased venoconstriction. The combined effect of chronic microcirculatory hypertension and inhibition of platelet aggregation due to diosmin may have predisposed to spontaneous hemorrhage in this anticoagulated patient. Individual cases such as this serve as a reminder that over-the-counter dietary supplements may be associated with serious adverse events. The practicing clinician should be aware of this possible adverse event when evaluating patients on oral anticoagulation and chronic diosmin treatment."
21324109,Management of aplastic anemia in a woman during pregnancy: a case report.,"Aplastic anemia is a rare disease caused by destruction of pluripotent stem cells in bone marrow. During pregnancy it could be life-threatening for both mother and child. The only causal therapy for aplastic anemia is bone marrow transplantation, which is contraindicated during pregnancy because of potential embryo toxicity. Treatment options are erythrocytes and platelet transfusions and immunosuppressive therapy. There is, however, no agreement about the optimal supportive care and treatment regime for this disorder during pregnancy.
A 26-year-old nulliparous Asian woman with an uneventful medical history was admitted to the hospital at 14 weeks' gestation because of excessive vomiting. Routine laboratory tests showed pancytopenia (Hb 3.5 mmol/L, leukocytes 3.5 *109/L, platelets 45 *109L). A bone marrow biopsy confirmed aplastic anemia. Methylprednisolon, cyclosporine A, packed cells and platelet transfusions were initiated. At 33 weeks she developed neutropenia (0.1 *109/L) for which oral colistin and tobramycin were given prophylactically. At 35 weeks labor was induced, during which she developed a fever of 38.2°C. She gave birth spontaneously to a healthy son weighing 2415 grams, who had no signs of pancytopenia. After delivery the blood count of the patient did not recover and did not respond to medication. Eighteen weeks after delivery she died of sepsis complicated by cerebral bleeding and infarction due to severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, despite optimal supportive treatment.
This potential life-threatening disease has a relatively good prognosis for both mother and child after optimal treatment. Transfusion during pregnancy is the first choice treatment with recommended hemoglobin levels of >5.5 mmol/L and platelet counts of >20 *109/L. Cyclosporine A seems a reasonable alternative therapy with a reported success rate in non-pregnant patients of 70% when combined with antithymocyte globuline. Our patient died 18 weeks postpartum from cerebral bleeding and infarction due to severe thrombocytopenia despite intensive supportive treatment, methylprednisolon and cyclosporine A."
21247473,Early intervention to promote oral feeding in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage: a retrospective cohort study.,"Stroke is a major cause of dysphagia, but little is known about when and how dysphagic patients should be fed and treated after an acute stroke. The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility, risks and clinical outcomes of early intensive oral care and a new speech and language therapist/nurse led structured policy for oral feeding in patients with an acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
A total of 219 patients with spontaneous ICH who were admitted to our institution from 2004 to 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. An early intervention program for oral feeding, which consisted of intensive oral care and early behavioral interventions, was introduced from April 2005 and fully operational by January 2006. Outcomes were compared between an early intervention group of 129 patients recruited after January 2006 and a historical control group of 90 patients recruited between January 2004 and March 2005. A logistic regression technique was used to adjust for baseline differences between the groups. To analyze time to attain oral feeding, the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used.
The proportion of patients who could tolerate oral feeding was significantly higher in the early intervention group compared with the control group (112/129 (86.8%) vs. 61/90 (67.8%); odds ratio 3.13, 95% CI, 1.59-6.15; P < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline imbalances, the odds ratio was 4.42 (95% CI, 1.81-10.8; P = 0.001). The incidence of chest infection was lower in the early intervention group compared with the control group (27/129 (20.9%) vs. 32/90 (35.6%); odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI, 0.26-0.88; P = 0.016). A log-rank test found a significant difference in nutritional supplementation-free survival between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.94, 95% CI, 1.46-2.71; P < 0.001).
Our data suggest that the techniques can be used safely and possibly with enough benefit to justify a randomized controlled trial. Further investigation is needed to solve the eating problems that are associated with patients recovering from a severe stroke."
21225777,"Case report: mediastinal hematoma secondary to hypertension, presenting as a retropharyngeal space abscess.","The majority of retropharyngeal hematomas described in the literature have been associated with anticoagulation therapy, tumors, aneurysm, infection or cervical spine injury. We present a case of a 55-year-old African American female with acute chest pain, sore throat, and dysphagia. Her past medical history was significant for uncontrolled hypertension and cervical spine arthritis. Physical exam was significant for posterior pharyngeal edema and her labs indicated mild leukocytosis. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck demonstrated an extensive retropharyngeal fluid collection with mediastinal extension, concerning for an abscess. A trans-oral and trans-cervical incision and drainage of the presumed abscess revealed clotted blood and venous ooze. Penrose drains were placed in the retropharyngeal space to allow for spontaneous drainage over the next two days. The patient was kept intubated for 8 days to ensure a secure airway while venous ooze was allowed to self-tamponade. Antihypertensive medications were utilized to control her labile blood pressures. To our knowledge this is the first case report of uncontrolled chronic hypertension as the etiology of a spontaneous mediastinal venous hematoma with presentation as a retropharyngeal space fluid collection. When evaluating retropharyngeal space occupying lesion with mediastinal extension, consideration should be given to mediastinal venous plexus bleeding. Treatment involves securing the airway, drainage, and control of blood pressure."
21175790,Systematic review of hepatocellular adenoma in China and other regions.,"Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign liver neoplasm with a risk of spontaneous bleeding and malignant transformation. The aim of this review article is to review all the case reports and case series of patients with HCA from 1998 to 2008 in China and other parts of the world in order to compare clinical presentation, surgical management and outcomes. A search for all reports of HCA in the world literature from 1998 to 2008 was performed. A total of 356 patients were identified, including 191 patients from China, 104 from Europe, 46 from North America, and 15 from South-East Asia. A female predominance was not observed in Chinese patients in contrast to the other regions. Acute/chronic abdominal pain was the main clinical presentation in all regions. Twenty patients were diagnosed with coexistent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) was found among six of them. The management of HCA consisted of resection in most cases. The clinical presentation of HCA in China differed from other parts of the world regarding male predominance and a higher incidence of coexistent HCC in China. This might be the result of the birth control policy in China, limited oral contraceptive use, and the higher incidence of HBV."
21169826,The acute management of intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, providing substantial scope for improvements in outcome. This review will discuss recent developments and present consensus evidence for the management of ICH.
Intracranial management strategies focus on preventing further bleeding and minimizing the risk of hematoma expansion and cerebral ischemia. Known coagulopathies should be corrected and oral anticoagulation reversed, but there is no evidence for the routine transfusion of platelets in patients taking aspirin or clopidogrel. Recombinant factor VIIa reduces hematoma expansion after ICH, but does not improve outcome and is associated with thromboembolic complications. The role and type of surgical interventions remain controversial. Early aggressive treatment, including meticulous control of blood pressure and other systemic physiological variables, improves outcome as does management in a specialized neurointensive care unit. Thromboembolic prophylaxis is routine but prophylactic antiepileptic drugs confer no benefit. Ongoing research seeks to define optimal blood pressure, glucose and temperature targets, the role and type of surgery, and potential neuroprotective strategies.
Well organized, multimodal therapy optimizing intracranial and systemic physiological variables improves outcome after ICH. Recent guidelines provide a useful consensus evidence-based framework for the management of acute ICH."
21159044,Rhabdomyolysis caused by tocolytic therapy with oral ritodrine hydrochloride in a pregnant woman with placenta previa.,"Oral-ritodrine-hydrochloride-induced rhabdomyolysis is rare. We report a case of oral-ritodrine-hydrochloride-induced rhabdomyolysis in a pregnant woman with placenta previa without neuromuscular disorders. The patient was a 30-year-old, Japanese primigravida woman, who became pregnant spontaneously. At 23 gestational weeks, she was diagnosed as having placenta previa and prophylactic oral ritodrine hydrochloride (15 mg/day) was initiated. At 29 1/7 gestational weeks, she was referred to our hospital for perinatal management of placenta previa. Two days thereafter, vaginal bleeding accompanied by frequent uterine contractions occurred and she was admitted. On admission, laboratory tests revealed an abnormal increase of blood creatine kinase (CK) value of 7200 IU/L. CK-MB isoenzyme was 208 IU/L. Aspartate transaminase (163 IU/L), alanine transaminase (74 IU/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (536 IU/L) levels were also increased. The patient started to complain of extreme muscle pain in her upper and lower limbs and general weakness. The next day, laboratory tests revealed a tremendous increase of blood CK level of 87,300 IU/L, a blood myoglobin level of 11,200 ng/mL, and a urinary myoglobin level of 615 ng/mL. An emergency cesarean section was carried out. After delivery, the laboratory data improved gradually with the CK levels at 107 IU/L. If patients complain of muscular symptoms following oral ritodrine hydrochloride use, physicians should consider rhabdomyolysis."

20701005,[Management and prevention of oral manifestations for blood dyscrasia and viral pathology].,"The study outlines the dentist's attitude in dealing with two of the many serious diseases throughout the body, HIV infection and acute leukemia. Many systemic diseases have oral manifestations which may appear at the beginning of any developed pathology, thus early detection can occasionally occur at the dental clinic. Gingival lesions are the most common oral phenomenon known for leukemia and HIV infection. In this case an early detection of pathology at the dental clinic was based on an uncommon and single presenting sign of massive spontaneous gingival bleeding. The objectives are demonstrate this unusual sign of blood dyscrasia and HIV infection in oral cavity and establishing management and prevention of oral manifestations for blood dyscrasia and pathology with viral etiology.
We investigated 225 cases had pathology with viral etiology. The patients entered the study HIV/AIDS in Botosani, Suceava, Neami during 2004-2008. All patients had a detailed medical history and examination as well as a thorough oral examination, which were all done without prior knowledge of the patient's HIV serostatus.
Oral disease is frequently associated with HIV. While nearly all oral disorders associated with HIV infection also occur in other conditions characterized by immunosuppression, no other condition is associated with as wide and significant a spectrum of oral disease as is HIV infection. Many HIV associated oral disorders occur early in HIV infection, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of associated oral disease should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Likewise, awareness of the variety of oral disorders which can develop throughout the course of HIV infection, and coordination of health care services between physician and dentist, should improve overall health and comfort of the patient. This paper reviews the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of HIV associated oral disorders.
Diseases with a particular viral etiology infectiousness have a special resurgence. For the dentist, their recognition has a particularly importance for the quick and accurate determination of the diagnose and for the establishing, together with the infectious disease physician, of the appropriate treatment. Working with the department of epidemiology is useful to define the preventive measures among the community."

The ultrasound and abdominal CT showed a thickened small bowel wall mainly involving duodenum and jejunum. The endoscopy showed an ecchymotic aspect of duodenum and jejunum. The patient received conservative medical treatment and her symptoms spontaneously subsided."
20362347,Should all patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation be anticoagulated?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. The prevalence and incidence of AF are rising, as confirmed in several European and American registries. Guidelines published in 2008 from the European Society of Cardiology/American Heart Association and from the American College of Chest Physicians, clarified the strategy of antithrombotic treatment in AF, which is based on the presence of risk factors for thromboembolism. This approach allows physicians to classify patients as at low, moderate or high risk, according to their individual risk characteristics, which are relatively similar in both sets of recommendations. Patients at moderate risk, however, who might justify anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment, could be better characterized using morphological (echocardiographic) and/or biological factors or risk markers. Recent data have shown that the existence of a thrombogenic milieu in the left atrium (e.g., dilatation of the left atrial appendage and/or thrombus and/or spontaneous echocontrast and/or reduced emptying/filling flow velocity) indicates a higher risk of embolism and mortality. Furthermore, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and haemostasis markers of coagulation are associated with thromboembolic risk and excess mortality in AF. Although current recommendations for the management of AF are not based on such markers, both could help physicians choose the optimal antithrombotic treatment (either vitamin K antagonists or antiplatelet drugs) according to the patient's specific risk profile. Nowadays, registries confirm under-prescription of vitamin K antagonist treatment in the 'real world,' even in patients at high thromboembolic risk, and over-prescription for at least one-third of low-risk patients. It is crucially important to realize that the risk of bleeding in patients with risk factors (e.g., older age, hypertension) is close to the risk of thromboembolism, which can have devastating outcomes in patients in AF. Alternative and efficient strategies (new oral anticoagulants, non-surgical closure of the left atrial appendage using percutaneous devices) are currently under investigation. Therefore reducing the risk of thromboembolism should be physicians' primary aim, particularly with the advent of alternative treatments and the development of new antithrombotic drugs such as oral thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials."

The soft palate is most commonly affected, but angina bullosa hemorrhagica may also appear on the buccal mucosa, lips and tongue border. Clinically, the blisters have a dark red to purple appearance, and may or may not be painful. The blisters usually break, releasing bloody content and leaving an ulcer surface that heals within 7 to 10 days. In this article the authors describe four cases of angina bullosa hemorrhagica attended in Stomatology Department of Dental School, Sao Paulo State University. In case 1, a 29-year-old male presented with a sudden hemorrhagic blister on the soft palate. A drainage was performed and after seven days of follow-up the patient reported no symptoms. In case 2, a 63-year-old male presented complaining of a blister on the palate six days earlier that had spontaneously broken. General exam showed hypertension under medical control. An incisional biopsy was performed and after seven days follow-up the healing was completed. In case 3, a 61-year-old male arrived complaining of a sudden appearance of an hemorrhagic blister on the soft palate that had spontaneously broken. The patient had systemic hypertension under medical control. The ulcer healed in 10 days follow-up. In case 4, a 49-year-old woman presented complaining of pain and an ulcer on the soft palate. The patient reported the rapid onset of a blood blister during a meal that broke in few minutes. The resolution occurred after 14 days. Angina bullosa hemorrhagica seems to be more common than reported in the literature and knowledge of the condition is important to right diagnosis and approach when necessary."
20357452,Management of ruptured hepatocellular adenoma.,"Hepatocellular adenoma (HA) is an increasingly prevalent benign liver tumor that is strongly associated with use of oral contraceptive medication. The diagnosis is often made after abdominal imaging in female patients with sudden abdominal pain, with or without signs of hemorrhage. Especially larger adenomas are of potential hazard to patients, because of the increased likelihood of rupture or malignant degeneration. Standard treatment of larger adenomas has since long consisted in surgical resection, both for non-ruptured and for ruptured tumors. Although resection is still considered the gold standard, recent reports have advocated initial conservative management. Recently, newer and less invasive methods using selective transarterial embolization have been described that can successfully stop bleeding and even lead to tumor regression. This review addresses different treatment options and recent advances regarding this relatively new condition, focusing mainly on treatment of bleeding and ruptured tumors in an acute setting. A possible algorithm for optimal treatment is presented."
20304282,Postoperative management following sphincter pharyngoplasty.,"To evaluate postoperative airway-associated outcomes following sphincter pharyngoplasty.
Case series with chart review.
Academic tertiary care medical center.
Postoperative management of sphincter pharyngoplasty (SP) conventionally includes overnight observation to monitor for upper airway obstruction. To evaluate for postoperative airway-related outcomes, 36 patients who underwent SP between April 2003 and January 2009 were evaluated retrospectively.
Mean patient age was 8.1 (SD 4.3) years. Mean follow-up was 6.5 (SD 10.7) months. Cleft palate (36.1%), velo-cardio-facial syndrome (22.2%), and post-adenoidectomy (16.7%) were the most common causes of velopharyngeal insufficiency. All patients underwent overnight observation postoperatively. Mean hospital stay was 1.2 (SD 0.5) days. Five patients remained inpatient two or three days owing to fever (2 patients), bleeding ear after concurrent otoplasty (1 patient), minimal oropharyngeal bleeding with spontaneous resolution (1 patient), and medication allergy (1 patient). No patient had a documented apneic event or desaturation below 95 percent. Although no desaturations were documented, four patients received supplemental oxygen: three for less than two hours, and one for 12 hours. All patients had adequate oral intake and pain control on oral medications prior to discharge; nine patients required one to three doses of intravenous narcotic medication for pain on postoperative day zero.
Upper airway obstruction requiring overnight observation following SP is uncommon. In otherwise healthy patients, performing SP in an outpatient setting, given appropriate recovery room evaluation for airway concerns, oral intake, and pain control, should be considered."
20097586,Resection and immediate reconstruction of a pediatric vascular malformation in the mandible: case report.,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) within the mandible are rare and potentially life-threatening conditions that can pose a therapeutic dilemma. We present the case of a child with significant spontaneous gingival bleeding, radiographic evidence of a space-occupying lesion of the mandible, and delayed diagnosis and treatment because of parental reluctance to accept invasive treatment. Imaging studies and intravascular embolization with coils limited, but did not stop blood flow to this lesion. Resection of the mandible was the definitive treatment. The AVM was removed from the resected segment and the bone was replaced as a free graft, thereby avoiding a second site morbidity. Two years after surgery the replaced segment was well consolidated with moderate vertical resorption-remodeling."
19844810,Role of antiplatelet agents in hematoma expansion during the acute period of intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Oral anticoagulants have been associated with greater hematoma expansion in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reported use of antiplatelet agents also results in greater hematoma expansion.
Retrospective review of patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH diagnosed within 6 h of onset, who underwent follow-up head CT approximately 48 h later. Digital imaging analysis of initial and second CT scans was performed for comparison of hematoma volume changes between patients reporting and those not reporting antecedent antiplatelet use. Statistical analyses to determine predictors of ICH volume change and in-hospital mortality were also performed via multivariate regression models.
Of the 70 patients included, 17 were documented as taking antiplatelet agents. Groups were comparable regarding baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and the timing of CT scans was similar. Patients reporting antiplatelet use experienced greater absolute increase (7.7 ml vs. 5.5 ml) and proportional increase (110% vs. 21%) in ICH volume than those not reporting antiplatelet use, but these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.94 and 0.61 respectively; Wilcoxon test). Baseline hematoma volume tended to correlate with percentage volume increase (P < 0.1), whereas IVH was inversely associated with percent volume increase (P < 0.05). Age (P < 0.05), absolute volume increase (P < 0.005), and final volume (P < 0.001) were associated with in-hospital mortality, the rates of which were similar between the two study groups (18% vs. 17%).
Patients reporting antiplatelet use experienced similar degrees of hematoma expansion compared to patients not reporting antiplatelet use."
19832917,The role of oral hygiene in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired disease of children and adults defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent associated conditions or other causes of thrombocytopenia. Oral manifestations are gingival bleeding, petechiae, mucocutaneous bleeding and haemorrhage into tissues.
An 11-year-old Turkish female was referred to the periodontology clinic by the paediatric haematologist for the treatment of spontaneous gingival bleeding, gingival oedematous enlargement and hyperaemia. She was diagnosed as chronic ITP 6 months ago and she was told not to brush her teeth. She was also complaining with dull pain and oral malodor. She was motivated for oral hygiene and after consulting with paediatric haematologist, under the proper circumstances, dental plaque and calculus were removed. Healing was uneventful.
Oral hygiene motivation and dental plaque control is crucial in order to prevent gingival bleeding, inflammation and severe periodontal diseases in patients with haematologic disorders. Understanding of the oral findings is essential in the management of patients and close cooperation between patients' dentist and haematologist is needed. Dental consultation is essential for diagnosis and improvement of medical conditions. It is possible to obtain adequate oral hygiene with limited performance and haematologic disorders are not handicaps for dental/periodontal procedures under the proper circumstances."
19751858,Use of combined oral contraceptives post abortion.,"Providing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) following surgical or medical induced abortion offers women an opportune moment to initiate a reliable contraceptive method.
We conducted a systematic review, searching MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library for articles in any language concerning COC use following spontaneous, induced (medical or surgical) or septic abortion, from 1966 through June 2008. Seven articles were identified and evaluated using the United States Preventive Services Task Force system.
Immediate COC initiation after first-trimester medical or surgical induced abortion did not increase side effects or prolong vaginal bleeding compared with use of a placebo, copper-bearing intrauterine device (IUD), nonhormonal contraceptive method or COC initiation at a later time. Initiating COCs after first-trimester surgical abortion produced small increases in coagulation parameters compared with IUD use; although they are statistically significant, their clinical relevance is unlikely. No study examined second-trimester induced or spontaneous abortion, or septic abortion.
Evidence shows that COCs can be safely initiated immediately following surgical and medical abortion in the first-trimester of pregnancy."
19690662,Surgical management of spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular adenoma.,"Spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular adenoma (SRHA) is a rare life-threatening condition that may require surgical treatment to control hemorrhaging and also stabilize the patient. We report a series of emergency surgeries performed at our institution for this condition.
We reviewed medical records and radiology files of 28 patients (from 1989 to 2006) with a proven diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma (HA). Three (10.7%) of 28 patients had spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular adenoma, two of which were associated with intrahepatic hemorrhage while one had intraperitoneal bleeding. Two patients were female and one was male. Both female patients had a background history of oral contraceptive use. Sudden abdominal pain associated with hemodynamic instability occurred in all patients who suffered from spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular adenoma. The mean age was 41.6 years old. The preoperative assessment included liver function tests, ultrasonography and computed tomography.
The surgical approaches were as follows: right hemihepatectomy for controlling intraperitoneal bleeding, and right extended hepatectomy and non-anatomic resection of the liver for intrahepatic hemorrhage. There were no deaths, and the postoperative complications were bile leakage and wound infection (re-operation), as well as intraperitoneal abscess (re-operation) and pleural effusion.
Spontaneous ruptured hepatocellular adenoma may be treated by surgery for controlling hemorrhages and stabilizing the patient, and the decision to operate depends upon both the patient's condition and the expertise of the surgical team."
19577854,Spontaneous hepatic hemorrhage secondary to prolonged use of oral contraceptives.,"Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are the most commonly used form of contraception throughout the United States of America. The prolonged usage of oral contraceptives leads to a variety of complications, ranging from subclinical modifications of liver function tests to the development of benign and malignant tumors of the liver. Spontaneous hepatic hemorrhage secondary to oral contraceptive use was only reported once in the early 1980s. We report a case of spontaneous hepatic hemorrhage secondary to prolonged ingestion of combined OCPs followed by multiple pulmonary emboli without underlying thrombophilia."
19565427,"Epidemiology of preterm birth in Omdurman Maternity hospital, Sudan.","To investigate the prevalence and to identify risk factors for live singleton preterm birth in Omdurman Maternity hospital, Sudan.
Case-control study. Odds ratios were adjusted for the confounding factors using multiple logistic regression models.
Among 3240 live birth at maternity hospital during the 3 months period of the study, 126 (3.8%) were a live preterm birth. About 99 live preterm births at a mean (SD) of 32.7 (2.2) gestational weeks were included in the final analyses. About 80 (81.0%) of these 99 preterm births were spontaneous preterm births and the rest 19 (19.0%) were medically indicated preterm births. Univariate and Multivariate analyses showed that those women who had history of miscarriage, preterm birth, cesarean delivery, dental maneuver, and vaginal bleeding in the index pregnancy, both low body mass index (BMI) (<25) and high BMI (>30) and those women who had short interpregancy interval were at higher risk for preterm birth.
The study showed that spontaneous preterm birth predominates in this setting. Preterm birth has a tendency to recur. Infections (periodontal) and nutrition were the risk factors for preterm birth. More research is needed especially in the area of nutrition and oral hygiene."
19452242,Fatal hemoperitoneum due to rupture of the left gastric artery in a patient with microscopic polyangiitis.,"Microscopic polyangiitis is a vasculitis which primarily affects capillaries, venules or arterioles. Involvement of small and medium-sized arteries may also occur. A 70-year-old Japanese female with a fever and cough was diagnosed with pneumonia and antibiotics were administered. Her symptoms initially improved, but her fever recurred and she experienced malaise and loss of appetite. Her renal function gradually worsened and she was positive for myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA). She was referred to our hospital on the suspicion of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. However, her depressive mental symptoms did not allow her to undergo a renal biopsy. She was clinically diagnosed with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, and oral corticosteroids and intravenous methylprednisolone were administered. Her symptoms and renal function were improved, but she died suddenly 15 days after admission. An autopsy disclosed approximately 700 mL bloody ascites. Coagulation adhered to the lesser curvature of the stomach, but the source of hemorrhage could not be detected macroscopically because the gastric mucosa did not show abnormal findings. The histological findings revealed that the left gastric artery showed necrotizing angiitis and rupture. In the kidneys, cellular crescents were found in approximately 10%, fibrous crescents were found in approximately 10%, sclerosis and collapse were found approximately 30% of the glomeruli, and necrotizing angiitis was observed in interlobular arteries and arterioles. From these findings, she was finally diagnosed with microscopic polyangiitis. Microscopic polyangiitis is an extremely rare cause of spontaneous intraperitoneal bleeding, but it must be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis for the appropriate management of such patients."
19198584,Small bowel obstruction caused by intramural hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulant therapy.,"Intramural hemorrhage as a cause for small bowel obstruction is extremely rare. We presented an unusual case report of small bowel obstruction caused by intramural jejunal hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulant therapy. An 85-year-old male patient with atrial fibrillation on long-term warfarin presented with nausea and vomiting for 2 days, accompanied with no bowel movement since the onset. Physical exam was unremarkable except soft abdomen with distension but no tenderness, hyperactive bowel sounds and positive fecal occult blood test. Investigations showed anemia with hemoglobin/ hematocrit of 10 (g/dl) / 30%, prothrombin time with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 9.58. Abdominal x-ray showed air fluid levels suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computerized tomography showed circumferential wall thickening, luminal narrowing and partial small bowel obstruction secondary to intramural jejunal hemorrhage. Patient recovered completely 48 hours after medical treatment (nothing per oral, intravenous fluids, nasal gastric tube, Vitamin K, frozen fresh plasma and packed red blood cell transfusion). Spontaneous intramural small-bowel hematoma is rare and occurs in patients who receive excessive anticoagulation with warfarin or who have some other risk factors for bleeding. Intramural hematoma most commonly involves the jejunum, followed by the ileum and the duodenum. The spectrum of presentation is wide, from abdominal pain, emesis to gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage. Abdominal CT is the key for diagnosis, with characteristics including circumferential wall thickening, intramural hyperdensity, luminal narrowing, and intestinal obstruction. Early diagnosis is crucial because most patients are treated nonoperatively with a good outcome."
19132194,"High long-term absolute risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C or antithrombin.","Hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C and antithrombin are known risk factors for first venous thromboembolism. We assessed the absolute risk of recurrence, and the contribution of concomitant thrombophilic defects in a large cohort of families with these deficiencies. Annual incidence of recurrence was estimated in 130 deficient patients, with separate estimates for those with each of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin deficiency, and in eight non-deficient patients with prior venous thromboembolism. All patients were also tested for factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, high levels of factors VIII, IX and XI, and hyperhomocysteinemia. There were 81 recurrent events among 130 deficient patients. Median follow-up was 4.6 years. Annual incidences (95% confidence interval) of recurrent venous thromboembolism were 8.4% (5.8-11.7) for protein S deficiency, 6.0% (3.9-8.7) for protein C deficiency, 10.0% (6.1-15.4) for antithrombin deficiency, and overall 7.7% (6.1-9.5). Relative risk of recurrence in patients with a spontaneous versus provoked first event was 1.5 (0.95-2.3). Cumulative recurrence rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 15%, 38% and 53%. Relative risk of recurrence with concomitant defects was 1.4 (0.7-2.6) (1 defect) and 1.4 (0.8-2.7) (> or =2 defects). Annual incidence was 1.0% (0.03-5.5) in eight non-deficient patients. Annual incidence of major bleeding in deficient patients on oral anticoagulant treatment was 0.5% (0.2-1.0). We conclude that patients with a hereditary protein S, protein C or antithrombin deficiency appear to have a high absolute risk of recurrence. This risk is increased after a first spontaneous event, and by concomitance of other thrombophilic defects."
19129506,Prior antiplatelet use does not affect hemorrhage growth or outcome after ICH.,"To examine whether antiplatelet medication use at onset of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with hemorrhage growth and outcome after spontaneous ICH using a large, prospectively collected database from a recent clinical trial.
The Cerebral Hemorrhage and NXY-059 Treatment trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of NXY-059 after spontaneous ICH. We analyzed patients in the placebo arm, and correlated antiplatelet medication use at the time of ICH with initial ICH volumes, ICH growth in the first 72 hours, and modified Rankin Score at 90 days. Patients on oral anticoagulation were excluded.
There were 282 patients included in this analysis, including 70 (24.8%) who were taking antiplatelet medications at ICH onset. Use of antiplatelet medications at ICH onset had no association with the volume of ICH at presentation, growth of ICH at 72 hours, initial edema volume, or edema growth. In multivariable analysis, there was no association of use of antiplatelet medications with any hemorrhage expansion (relative risk [RR] 0.85 [upper limit of confidence interval (UCI) 1.03], p = 0.16), hemorrhage expansion greater than 33% (RR 0.77 [UCI 1.18], p = 0.32), or clinical outcome at 90 days (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.39-1.14, p = 0.14).
Use of antiplatelet medications at intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) onset is not associated with increased hemorrhage volumes, hemorrhage expansion, or clinical outcome at 90 days. These findings suggest that attempts to reverse antiplatelet medications after ICH may not be warranted."
21726472,Subarachnoid haemorrhage (spontaneous aneurysmal).,"Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) may arise spontaneously or as a result of trauma. Spontaneous SAH accounts for about 5% of all strokes. Ruptured aneurysms are the cause of 85% of spontaneous SAH. The most characteristic clinical feature is sudden-onset severe headache. Other features include vomiting, photophobia, and focal neurological deficit or seizures, or both. As the headache may have insidious onset in some cases, or may even be absent, a high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose SAH with less typical presentations.
We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgical treatments for people with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage? What are the effects of medical treatments to prevent delayed cerebral ischaemia in people with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
We found 6 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: endovascular coiling; surgical clipping; timing of surgery; and oral and intravenous nimodipine."
18922339,Surgical results of the intraoral removal of the submandibular gland.,"Most patients with benign submandibular disorders have been treated surgically without difficulty via the transcervical approach. An alternative to the standard transcervical approach has been reported such as an intraoral approach.
Retrospective chart review of the 77 patients with benign submandibular disorders. All patients underwent an excision of the submandibular gland via intraoral approach.
Early postoperative complications developed in 74.0% of the temporary lingual sensory paresis followed by 70.1% of temporary limitation of tongue movement. However, these complications soon resolved in all patients spontaneously. Two cases of postoperative bleeding and 1 case of abscess formation were developed. Whereas late complications developed in 4 cases of residual salivary gland and abnormal sense of mouth floor and 1 case of gustatory sweating (Frey's) syndrome.
The major advantages of this approach are no external scar, no injury to the marginal mandibular nerve. The disadvantage is a more difficult dissection to transcervical approach before proper expert, especially in the severe adhesion of salivary gland to surrounding tissue."
18703803,Hematoma growth in oral anticoagulant related intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Limited data suggest that intracerebral hemorrhage related to oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT ICH) is associated with more hemorrhage expansion and a worse prognosis than spontaneous ICH (SICH).
We examined patients enrolled in the placebo arm of the CHANT study, a prospective randomized trial of a putative neuroprotectant in patients with ICH. All patients had neuroimaging within 6 hours of symptom onset and at 72 hours. Initial ICH volume and hemorrhage expansion were determined by a central reader. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with ICH expansion and mortality at 90 days.
Of 303 patients included, 21 (6.9%) had OAT ICH. Baseline median ICH volume was greater in patients with OAT ICH compared to SICH (30.6 versus 14.4 mL, P=0.03). Hemorrhage expansion (defined as >33% increase in ICH volume) occurred in 56% of patients with OAT ICH compared to 26% of SICH (P=0.006). Mortality was substantially higher in OAT ICH (62% versus 17%, P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, time to neuroimaging and oral anticoagulant use were independently associated with hemorrhage expansion, and age, gender, and oral anticoagulant use were independently associated with mortality.
These findings confirm that OAT ICH is associated with more hemorrhage expansion and greater mortality than SICH."
20084800,Gastrosplenic fistula following chemotherapy for lymphoma.,"Gastrosplenic fistula resulting from erosion of a primary splenic lymphoma is a very rare cause of massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage as compared to benign peptic ulcer disease, gastric Crohn's disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and primary gastric and splenic lymphomas. This hemorrhage can be successfully managed by splenic artery embolization, followed by splenectomy and gastric resection. A 50-year-old patient developed a gastrosplenic fistula during a course of chemotherapy for differentiated histiocytic lymphoma. The fistula was demonstrated by CT scan with oral contrast. The fistula was followed endoscopically and noted to have closed spontaneously with confirmed closure at laparotomy. The clinical management of this complication is discussed, and the literature pertaining to this rare condition is reviewed."

17907499,Spontaneous bleeding in a patient of rheumatoid arthritis: a complication after accidental overdose of methotrexate.,
17846670,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura presenting as post-extraction hemorrhage.,"The aim of this article is to present a case of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in order to emphasize the importance of the clinical exam since the anamnesis leads to a diagnostic hypothesis of ITP.
Acute ITP is considered an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies against platelets, antigens produced by a viral infection, or a platelet sparing drug combination. These antibodies adhere to platelets and are recognized and destroyed by the reticulo-endothelial system. Consequently, the platelet count gradually diminishes and is insufficient for the maintenance of primary hemostasis.
A 77-year-old woman presented with post-extraction intermittent bleeding. The physical examination revealed discoloration of the skin, multiple petechiae, hematomas, ecchymosis of the upper lip, bruises all over the body, gingiva that bled spontaneously, and a malformed blood clot at the extraction site of tooth #44. The hematological exams confirmed the hypothesis of ITP. The patient was immediately hospitalized in the Hematology Department of a local hospital and received platelet replacement, hydration, medication, and general care. After the spontaneous bleeding stopped, the malformed clot was removed using alveolar curettage along with a thorough cleaning of the extraction site with a 0.9% saline solution before suturing the wound and prescribing medication. After the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient presented with the following results: Hb: 12.3 mg/dL, Ht: 36.1%, and PC: 87,000 mm3. The patient was then discharged and was placed under outpatient follow-up care.
The importance of the clinical exam must be emphasized since the anamnesis leads to a diagnostic hypothesis of ITP and provides the dental surgeon with an opportunity to make important systemic alterations to improve the prognosis of a patient with ITP."
17618446,The effect of ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate treatment on homocysteine levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular risk marker homocysteine (Hcy) is elevated in women with PCOS. This prospective study investigated the effect of oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol-cyproterone acetate (EE-CA) on serum Hcy levels in women with PCOS.
A total of 30 women with PCOS were enrolled in this prospective study. The diagnosis of PCOS was made according to the criteria of the Rotterdam PCOS consensus workshop group. All women took oral contraceptives containing EE/CA (35 microg/2 mg) for 3 months. Serum samples for Hcy, lipid profile and hormones were obtained during the early follicular phase (days 3-5) of the spontaneous or progestin-induced bleeding at baseline, and after the third treatment cycle.
Three months of EE-CA therapy significantly decreased the Hcy levels from 55.97 +/- 16.04 to 54.03 +/- 16.15 (P = 0.01). A significant correlation was observed between the Hcy and total and free testosterone levels (r = 0.44, P = 0.015 and r = 0.46, P = 0.001 respectively).
Although the decrease in Hcy levels with EE-CA therapy was statistically significant, further studies are necessary to determine the clinical benefit of this treatment."
17525521,[A case of ulcerative colitis relapsed by influenza vaccination].,"Although a large number of studies have reported the causes of the exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC), the effect of influenza vaccination on the relapse of UC has not been reported. We experienced a case of prompt exacerbation of quiescent UC due to influenza vaccination. A 39-year-old woman was diagnosed as UC 4-years ago and was well controlled with oral mesalazine. She experienced abdominal pain and frequent bowel movements with hematochezia 3 days after the vaccination. On admission, laboratory findings showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Sigmoidoscopy showed marked edematous mucosa on rectum and sigmoid colon with fine ulceration and spontaneous bleeding. She recovered from the exacerbation of UC after steroid treatment. Vaccination should be administered to the patients with inflammatory bowel disease with the caution of its possible side effects."
17521051,Imaging management of spontaneous giant esophageal intramural hematoma.,"A woman, aged 84 years, presented to our emergency department with posteriorly radiating chest pain that began following dinner. She reported no change in bowel habits, hematochezia, or melena. She had previous peptic ulcer disease and a long-standing history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medications included acetylsalicylic acid and rabeprazole. Electrocardiogram and troponin analyses were negative for ischemic heart disease. The emergency physician suspected an aortic dissection, and computed tomography (CT) chest and abdomen scans were performed with and without IV and oral contrast. The aorta was normal and the noncontrast images demonstrated a hyperdense mass (not shown) that did not enhance consistent with a large intramural hematoma extending from the upper esophagus (level of T2 vertebral body) to the fundus of the stomach (Figures 1A and B)."
17366560,Hemoperitoneum from ruptured cyst in a hyperstimulated ovary: a sonographic mimic of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.,"We report a case of a ruptured cyst in a hyperstimulated ovary that was initially misinterpreted as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). A 22-year-old woman who was on oral clomiphene citrate for primary infertility presented with pain in the lower abdomen, hypotension, and tachycardia. Sonographic examination revealed multiple cysts in both ovaries and free fluid in the abdomen, and the initial diagnosis was OHSS. However, sonographically guided aspiration of free fluid revealed a hemoperitoneum, and the patient underwent emergent surgery. At laparotomy, an actively bleeding ruptured cyst in a hyperstimulated ovary was found to be the cause of the hemoperitoneum. Radiologists must be familiar with the imaging features of this condition to avoid misdiagnosing it as OHSS, because this could potentially delay urgently required surgery."
17344166,[Bacterial infections in liver cirrhosis].,"Bacterial infections are well described complications of cirrhosis that greatly increase mortality rates. Two factors play important roles in the development of bacterial infections in these patients: the severity of liver disease and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The most common infections are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia and sepsis. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are equal causative organisms. For primary prophylaxis, short-term antibiotic treatment (oral norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin) is indicated in cirrhotic patients (with or without ascites) admitted with gastrointestinal haemorrhage (variceal or non-variceal). Administration of norfloxacin is advisable for hospitalized patients with low ascitic protein even without gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The first choice in empirical treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the iv. III. generation cephalosporin; which can be switched for a targeted antibiotic regime based on the result of the culture. The duration of therapy is 5-8 days. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and fluoroquinolones--patients not on prior quinolone prophylaxis--were shown to be as effective and safe as cefotaxime. In patients with evidence of improvement, iv. antibiotics can be switched safely to oral antibiotics after 2 days. In case of renal dysfunction, iv albumin should also be administered. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients who have recovered from an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (secondary prevention). For ""selective intestinal decontamination"", poorly absorbed oral norfloxacin is the preferred schedule. Oral ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (added gram positive spectrum) all the more are reasonable alternatives. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is only for patients who are intolerant to quinolones. Prophylaxis is indefinite until disappearance of ascites, transplant or death. Long-term prophylaxis is currently not recommended for patients without previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis episode, not even when refractory ascites or low ascites protein content is present."
17314111,Early decrease in coagulation activity after myocardial infarction is associated with lower risk of new ischaemic events: observations from the ESTEEM Trial.,"Patients with a recent myocardial infarction have an increased risk of recurrent ischaemic events. In the ESTEEM trial, the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran reduced the risk of new ischaemic events when compared with placebo in aspirin treated post myocardial infarction patients. Ximelagatran persistently reduced markers of coagulation activity, i.e. prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) and D-dimer levels. The aim of this substudy was to evaluate the levels of these markers and activated thromboplastin time (APTT) in relation to new ischaemic events or bleeding.
In the substudy, 518 out of 1883 patients were included and within 14 days after a myocardial infarction randomized to ximelagatran or placebo for 6 months. The clinical endpoints death, myocardial infarction, severe recurrent ischaemia, ischaemic stroke, and bleeding were evaluated. The levels of F1 + 2, D-dimer, and APTT were analysed at randomization and in serial samples during the study. Ximelagatran treatment appeared to have a larger treatment effect in patients with F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels above the median at randomization with a reduction of ischaemic events from 18 to 9% (P = 0.03) for F1 + 2 and from 20 to 9% for D-dimer (P = 0.009). A reduction of D-dimer levels was found in 60% of the patients 1 week after randomization and these patients had less ischaemic events when compared with patients with unchanged or increased levels (P = 0.03) regardless of treatment. F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels were unrelated to bleeding risk. In the ximelagatran group, increased APTT was not related to ischaemic events but associated with a raised risk of bleeding.
A reduction of initially high coagulation activity, as measured by the D-dimer level, in patients with recent myocardial infarction identifies patients with a decreased risk of new ischaemic events, regardless whether the reduction occurs spontaneously or is induced by pharmacological means. Patients with higher initial coagulation activity seemed to benefit most from long-term treatment with ximelagatran."
17218225,Villar's nodule: a case report and systematic literature review of endometriosis externa of the umbilicus.,"We report a case of umbilical endometriosis externa and systematically review the literature regarding this finding. In our case report, a 47-year-old woman with cyclic umbilical bleeding, pelvic pain, and no previous umbilical surgery developed a spontaneous umbilical endometrioma, cured by surgical resection and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In our review, 122 patients with documented umbilical endometriomas from 1966 to the present and 109 cases reported before 1953 were analyzed. Procedures used for diagnosis and/or therapeutic intervention included umbilical biopsy or resection, abdominal wall repair, diagnostic and/or operative laparoscopy, adhesiolysis, hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Variables included patient age; race; medical and surgical history; past use of oral contraceptives; history of umbilical pain, bleeding, or swelling; duration of signs and symptoms; size and color of the lesion; diagnostic evaluations; and medical or surgical management. Mean age of the study population was 37.7 +/- 0.98 years. Up to 40% of patients with extrapelvic endometriosis present with umbilical endometriomas, with symptoms occurring an average of 17.8 +/- 3.9 months before presentation. Lesions averaged 2.3 +/- 0.2 cm in diameter; were predominantly brown (19.1%), blue (13.2%), or purple (10.3%); and patients frequently had with pain (77.93%), cyclical bleeding (47.1%), and swelling (88.2%). Most patients had no history of endometriosis (73.1%), and laparoscopic, umbilical trocar-related seeding was identified in only 5 patients. Three patients received medical management, and surgical management was invariably curative, though 1 patient required repeat surgical therapy. Umbilical endometriosis is a common manifestation of external endometriosis, representing primary or secondary endometriosis, with a typical presentation that has little variation. Laparoscopic endometrioid tissue excision can result in iatrogenic seeding to the umbilicus. Historical and physical findings are pathognomonic, thus justifying a formal name--Villar's nodule, after the initial reporting physician. Surgical intervention is recommended, but medical therapy may result in long-term symptom control with minimal malignancy risk."
16847397,Intracranial haemorrhage in patients on antithrombotics: clinical presentation and determinants of outcome in a prospective multicentric study in Italian emergency departments.,"Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is the type of stroke associated with the highest death rate, and about 30% of ICH occurs in patients on antithrombotic treatment. This study relates clinical presentations and outcome of ICH patients on oral anticoagulant (OA) or antiplatelet (AP) therapy admitted to 33 Italian emergency departments (ED).
Consecutive patients were enrolled after cranial computed tomography (CT). Primary outcome was the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score at 3 months of follow-up. Common descriptive statistics were computed after stratification for traumatic or spontaneous ICH and identification of the anatomical location of bleeding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of death.
We recruited 434 patients on AP therapy and 232 on OA. There were 432 spontaneous and 234 traumatic ICH patients. The proportions of AP and OA patients undergoing neurosurgery were 21.8 and 19.4%, respectively, while < 30% underwent procoagulant medical treatment. At the 3-month follow-up, the case fatality rate was 42.0%, while disability or death (MRS 3-6) was 68.1%. The odds ratio for death in OA versus AP patients was 2.63 (95% CI 1.73-4.00) in the whole population and 2.80 (95% CI 1.77-4.41) in intraparenchymal event patients. Glasgow Coma Scale, age, spontaneous event and anticoagulant use were found to be predictors of death both in traumatic and spontaneous events.
This study confirms the high prevalence of death or disability in OA and AP patients with ICH. As far as the determinants of mortality and disability are concerned, the results of this study might be useful in the clinical management and allocation of resources in the ED setting. The observed low use of procoagulant therapy highlights the need for ED educational programmes to heighten the awareness of available and effective haemostatic treatments."
16707509,"Management of miscarriage: expectant, medical, or surgical? Results of randomised controlled trial (miscarriage treatment (MIST) trial).","To ascertain whether a clinically important difference exists in the incidence of gynaecological infection between surgical management and expectant or medical management of miscarriage.
Randomised controlled trial comparing medical and expectant management with surgical management of first trimester miscarriage.
Early pregnancy assessment units of seven hospitals in the United Kingdom.
Women of less than 13 weeks' gestation, with a diagnosis of early fetal demise or incomplete miscarriage.
Expectant management (no specific intervention); medical management (vaginal dose of misoprostol preceded, for women with early fetal demise, by oral mifepristone 24-48 hours earlier); surgical management (surgical evacuation).
Confirmed gynaecological infection at 14 days and eight weeks; need for unplanned admission or surgical intervention.
1200 women were recruited: 399 to expectant management, 398 to medical management, and 403 to surgical management. No differences were found in the incidence of confirmed infection within 14 days between the expectant group (3%) and the surgical group (3%) (risk difference 0.2%, 95% confidence interval - 2.2% to 2.7%) or between the medical group (2%) and the surgical group (0.7%, - 1.6% to 3.1%). Compared with the surgical group, the number of unplanned hospital admissions was significantly higher in both the expectant group (risk difference - 41%, - 47% to - 36%) and the medical group (- 10%, - 15% to - 6%). Similarly, when compared with the surgical group, the number of women who had an unplanned surgical curettage was significantly higher in the expectant group (risk difference - 39%, - 44% to - 34%) and the medical group (- 30%, - 35% to - 25%).
The incidence of gynaecological infection after surgical, expectant, and medical management of first trimester miscarriage is low (2-3%), and no evidence exists of a difference by the method of management. However, significantly more unplanned admissions and unplanned surgical curettage occurred after expectant management and medical management than after surgical management.

16241918,Prognostic significance of glycaemic control in patients with HBV and HCV-related cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequently observed in patients with cirrhosis, particularly that due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, no studies have focused on the clinical significance of glycaemic control in cirrhotic patients because of their short life expectancy and poor hepatic function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of glycaemic control in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV-related cirrhosis and DM.
A total of 434 patients with HCV-related (HCV group, n = 88) or HBV-related (HBV group, n = 346) cirrhosis were studied retrospectively. We determined the prevalence of DM and treatment methods for hyperglycaemia and status of glycaemic control, and the patients' outcome.
The prevalence of DM was 43.2% (38/88) in the HCV group and 19.7% (68/346) in the HBV group. Patients in the HCV group were older with a female preponderance. DM was detected before the diagnosis of cirrhosis or simultaneously in 92% and 79% in the HCV and HBV groups, respectively. Most patients were treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents. However, blood glucose levels were maintained within the normal range in 34.2% of the HCV group and in 23.5% of the HBV group. Forty-six patients died during the observation period in both groups. Hepatic failure was the most common cause of death, and sepsis and variceal bleeding were more frequent in the HCV group than in the HBV group. Multivariate analysis showed that Child-Pugh class was the most important factor for survival in both groups. In the HCV group, the status of glycaemic control was a significant independent factor of survival (P = 0.018). In the HBV group, age and the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were significant.
DM is more frequent in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis than in patients with HBV. Strict control of blood glucose levels could improve survival in HCV patients. A precise assessment of the risks and benefits of glycaemic control is required to reduce the mortality and morbidity of patients with cirrhosis and DM."
16149013,Adverse reactions to anticoagulants and to antiplatelet drugs recorded by the German spontaneous reporting system.,"According to their code of professional conduct, German physicians are obliged to report suspected cases of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association (AkdA). On the basis of an agreement between the German Medical Association and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) a common pharmacovigilance database within the German spontaneous reporting system was created. A user-friendly application program developed in-house enables the user to conduct searches about reported ADRs covering a wide variety of questions within a short period of time. ADRs caused by anticoagulants and by antiplatelet drugs still belong to the most reported adverse events. The most frequently reported suspected drugs are heparins, followed by ticlopidine, phenprocoumon, acetylsalicylic acid, and clopidogrel. Bleeding complications are the most often described ADR symptoms of any anticoagulation therapy, especially of phenprocoumon and acetylsalicylic acid. Another serious ADR is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or changes in blood counts (CBC) due to ticlopidine and clopidogrel. During the past few years a reduction in severe reactions, such as cerebral hemorrhage, especially with fatal outcome was detectable because of better clinical management of oral anticoagulant therapy and of adverse events concerning heparin."

16018767,Periodontal treatment in severe aplastic anemia.,"Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare hematologic disease characterized by hypo-cellular bone marrow. The clinical features include fatigue, increased bruising, and gingival bleeding caused by anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. A patient with AA is at high risk for infection because of leukopenia. The risk of systemic infection is especially high in AA patients with severe local infections, including periodontitis. Accordingly, periodontal treatment should include antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of systemic infection. However, treatment of periodontitis in the AA patient is significantly complicated by the bleeding disorder. We present a case report of the successful periodontal treatment of an AA patient with spontaneous gingival bleeding.
The patient was closely monitored for platelet and neutrophil counts before every treatment. The patient's platelet count was always under 10,000/microl. Therefore, it was necessary to increase platelet counts to over 25,000/microl by transfusion, after which subgingival scaling with anesthesia was performed. When the neutrophil count was less than 2,000/microl, local minocycline chemotherapy was applied to the pockets. Periodontal infection was monitored by detection of bacterial DNA and measurement of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G titer against periodontal bacteria.
Following the physical and chemical treatment, the gingival appearance improved dramatically and the spontaneous gingival bleeding disappeared. Moreover, the IgG titer against periodontal bacteria decreased to normal range and specific periodontal pathogens were no longer detectable in the tested pockets.
We believe that the treatment strategy in the present report provides new sight into treatment planning for severely medically compromised patients."
16009774,Moyamoya syndrome with intraventricular hemorrhage in an adult with factor V Leiden mutation.,"To report a case of proximal occlusion of 2 major cerebral vessels associated with moyamoya network circulation that manifested by spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage.
Case report.
A 36-year-old Syrian man presented with symptoms of sudden-onset headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. The computed tomography scan of his brain showed intraventricular bleeding, and the subsequent 4 vessel angiographies revealed occlusion of the left middle and anterior cerebral arteries with moyamoya appearance in the terminal branches. The coagulation profile showed the presence of heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The patient was treated conservatively until resolution of his blood clot, and later he was started on oral anticoagulation.
Factor V Leiden mutation may cause large cerebral vessel occlusion with moyamoya syndrome in adults."
15936249,Treatment with oral bromelain decreases colonic inflammation in the IL-10-deficient murine model of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Bromelain is a mixture of proteinases derived from pineapple stem that is marketed in health food stores as a ""digestive aid"". Orally administered bromelain was anecdotally reported to induce clinical and endoscopic remission of ulcerative colitis in two patients whose disease was refractory to multi-agent conventional medical therapy. However, the potential efficacy of bromelain in colitis has not yet been tested rigorously in either animals or humans. In this study, the clinical and histologic severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was determined in IL-10-/- mice treated orally with bromelain in vivo. Daily treatment with oral bromelain beginning at age 5 weeks decreased the incidence and severity of spontaneous colitis in C57BL/6 IL-10-/- mice. Bromelain also significantly decreased the clinical and histologic severity of colonic inflammation when administered to piroxicam-exposed IL-10-/- mice with established colitis. Proteolytically active bromelain was required for anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Adverse effects of dermatitis, hair loss, and weight loss due to mucositis were rare, dose related, and were not seen in wild-type mice treated orally with up to 1000 mg bromelain/kg/day for 18 weeks. Although the exact mechanisms by which exogenous proteinases affect bowel inflammation have not yet been determined, the results justify additional studies of this complementary biologically based approach to treatment of IBD."
15547819,Ruptured hemorrhagic cyst in an undescended ovary.,"The authors report on a patient with an uncommon congenital anomaly of bilateral undescended ovaries and tubes. She presented with an acute abdomen at 13 years of age. A computed tomography scan showed a cystic mass suspicious for congenital intestinal duplication. At the time of laparoscopy, she was found to have a bicornuate uterus and bilateral undescended ovaries with a ruptured right hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. This case shows that although a ruptured ovarian cyst can occur in such malpositioned organs, it can pose difficult diagnostic challenges. Suppression of the ovaries with the combined oral contraceptive pill may help to prevent further ovarian cyst development."
15459841,[Cataract surgery under topical anesthesia with oral anticoagulants].,"Approximately 14 % of cataract surgery patients receive blood-thinning agents. In a prospective study, the influence of oral anticoagulants on intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhages in patients undergoing cataract surgery in topical anesthesia was investigated.
128 patients presenting for cataract surgery under oral anticoagulation were included. The mean preoperative prothrombin time was 39 +/- 18 %. Most patients (81 %) continued their oral anticoagulation (prothrombin time 34 +/- 13 %). All surgeries were performed in topical anesthesia.
In 9 patients (7 %) an ocular hemorrhagic event was observed. These were not sight-threatening and resorbed spontaneously within a few days. Only one patient (0.8 %) had a slight hemorrhage in the anterior chamber. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between patients with or without hemorrhagic complications in the postoperative visual acuity, the intraocular pressure, the prothrombin time or the discontinuation of oral anticoagulants.
Cataract surgery in topical anesthesia under oral anticoagulation did not increase the risk of sight-threatening hemorrhages. The continuation of oral anticoagulation seems particularly indicated for ambulatory cataract surgery."
15193066,"Oral, nasal, and cutaneous eosinophilic granulomas in the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis): a lesion distinct from superficial necrolytic dermatitis.","Oral, nasal, and cutaneous lesions resembling eosinophilic granulomas (EGs) were observed in eight captive black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis). Oral lesions were observed in all affected animals and occurred most often behind the prehensile lip. The typical clinical history of affected animals included oral bleeding or epistaxis from multilobulated, fungating, proliferative masses with areas of ulceration. Histologically, lesions were characterized by prominent infiltrates of eosinophils and rare foci of collagen degeneration on a background of marked submucosal or dermal neovascularization. Mucosal or epidermal hyperplasia was also present sometimes in association with distinctive epithelial degenerative changes consistent with superficial necrolytic dermatopathy of black rhinoceroses. Lesions of EG and superficial necrolytic dermatopathy were interpreted as being concurrently manifested in these cases. EG lesions spontaneously resolved over periods of 30 days-7 mo and were recurrent in three animals. Lesions were responsive to treatment with corticosteroids or to local cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. Two animals treated with systemic corticosteroids died of disseminated fungal infections, emphasizing that corticosteroids should be used cautiously in black rhinoceroses."
15137613,Progressive neurological decline after partial spontaneous thrombosis of a Spetzler-Martin Grade 5 arteriovenous malformation in a patient with Leiden factor V mutation: management and outcome.,"The coexistence of a large intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and a hypercoagulation disorder is rare. The AVM puts the patient at risk for progressive neurological deficit, seizures, and, most importantly, intracranial hemorrhage The hypercoagulation disorder may result in an increased risk of stroke. The authors describe a 42-year-old man with a Spetzler-Martin Grade 5 AVM who experienced progressive neurological decline. He was subsequently discovered to have partial thrombosis of the AVM, deep cerebral and cortical venous thrombosis, and a hypercoagulation disorder. Hypercoagulation disorders causing neurological deficits are usually treated with anticoagulant medications; however, this approach was not thought to be safe in the presence of a large AVM. Therefore, the AVM nidus was surgically extirpated and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed to treat the increased intracranial pressure caused by the cortical and deep cerebral venous thrombosis. Subsequently, lifelong oral anticoagulation was prescribed. The patient had a progressive neurological recovery and is now living independently at home. The occurrence of partial or complete spontaneous thrombosis of an AVM nidus should raise the possibility of an underlying hypercoagulation disorder."
15133567,[Discussion of surgical laser manipulation of venous malformations in the parotid gland region].,"This study is carried to explore the surgical manipulation and complications of Nd:YAG laser coagulation for venous malformations in parotid gland region.
The study included 84 cases of venous malformations in the parotid gland region, who underwent laser therapy after surgical approach three years ago. The results were evaluated by CT or MRI. Postoperative facial nerve function and intraoperative bleeding were analyzed.
Five cases had temporary facial nerve paralysis, which recovered spontaneously two months postoperatively. One case developed permanent nerve paralysis, which accounted for 1.19% in this group. The mean amount of blood loss was 200 ml. Four cases received blood transfusion.
Careful surgical dissection and correct laser irradiation is the key to successful treatment, which could preserve facial nerve from injury and decrease bleeding."
15098885,Avoiding menstruation: a review of health and lifestyle issues.,"This article (1) reviews the decades-long history of short-term dosing regimens delaying the onset of expected, spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding in oral contraceptive users up to 20 days; (2) outlines treatment schedules that suppress menstrual bleeding for several months; and (3) evaluates the recently approved extended dosing regimen of 3 months' duration. For single-term postponement of normal menses, estrogen-progestogen combinations can be employed, starting about 7 days after ovulation. Oral contraceptive users can skip the 7-day pill-free period and continue with the active pills in the next package. The main focus of this review is the development of extended dosing schedules that result in cycles lasting 7 weeks up to several months and reduce the number of periods of bleeding and menstrual discomfort. Recently a dosing schedule was introduced into clinical use consisting of ethinyl estradiol, 30 microg, plus levonorgestrel, 150 microg/d, for 84 days, followed by 7 days of placebo. The pregnancy rate was < 1% for compliant women and 1.5% for all participants. A monophasic 21 + 7-day combination using the same daily doses had slightly higher pregnancy rates. The discontinuation rate for unscheduled bleeding and spotting was higher with extended dosing than with the conventional, 21 + 7 schedule."
15088888,Severe gingival bleeding in a myelodysplastic patient: management and outcome.,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of stem cell disorders characterized by a reduction in one or more elements of the peripheral blood. Oral manifestations of the disease and oral complications of medical management may result in significant symptoms and have an impact on the systemic condition of the patient. The removal of the infectious focus, such active teeth infection or severe periodontal disease, remains controversial in these patients, due to the increased risk of bleeding and systemic infection.
This paper reports a case of MDS with spontaneous gingival hemorrhage and generalized gingival hyperplasia associated with periodontal disease. This patient underwent several platelet transfusions due to these oral complications. The patient received periodontal therapy, resulting in an improvement of the oral clinical situation and a decrease of gingival hyperplasia.
The patient did not present any episode of gingival hemorrhage after the periodontal treatment.
The results of this study suggest that periodontal therapy should be performed in MDS patients presenting thrombocytopenia, gingival hyperplasia, and gingival bleeding, with the intent of preventing further hemorrhagic episodes and possible systemic infection."

While PA is occasionally associated with cystic change or hemorrhage necrosis, spontaneous infarction appears to be very uncommon. We report two unusual cases of extensive necrosis of PA; one occurred in the palate with the necrotic tumor mass slipping into the oral cavity. This phenomenon, possibly associated with incision biopsy, has never been described previously. A second case, arising in the parotid with spontaneous tumor necrosis, poses some dilemma in differential diagnosis."
14734332,Resolution of left atrial thrombus after 6 months of anticoagulation in candidates for percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy.,"Resolution of left atrial thrombus after long-term oral anticoagulation enhances safe percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC); however, the short-term benefit has not been defined.
To estimate the resolution rate of left atrial thrombus among PTMC candidates after 6 months of oral anticoagulation and to determine its main predictors.
Prospective cohort.
Community-based university medical center.
219 PTMC candidates with thrombus demonstrated by multiplane transesophageal echocardiographic studies.
The primary outcome was the status of the thrombus at the first 6-month follow-up; secondary measures were bleeding or thromboembolic complications.
Among 219 PTMC candidates with left atrial thrombus (mean age [+/-SD], 39.6 +/- 7.4 years [range, 19 to 62 years]), complete resolution of thrombus, with an overall disappearance rate of 24.2% (95% CI, 18.5% to 29.9%), was demonstrated in 53 patients who subsequently underwent successful PTMC. In another 166 patients, the thrombus size was reduced by 24% (P < 0.001). No thrombus resolution was observed in the 27 patients with a left atrial body thrombus. Eighteen patients had minor bleeding. The significant predictors of thrombus resolution were a New York Heart Association class of 2 or less, a left atrial appendage thrombus size of 1.6 cm2 or less, a left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic contrast grade of 1 or less, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of at least 2.5. Patients with all of these predictors had a 94.4% chance of complete thrombus resolution (CI, 84.4% to 98.1%).
After 6 months of oral anticoagulation, the left atrial thrombus disappeared in about a quarter of PTMC candidates so they could safely undergo PTMC. Less clinical severity, lower grading of the left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, a smaller thrombus, and a higher INR level predict thrombus resolution."
14712330,A case of familial Mediterranean fever and polyarteritis nodosa complicated by spontaneous perirenal and subcapsular hepatic hemorrhage requiring multiple arterial embolizations.,"The association of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) has been well established. These patients have been reported to have an overall better prognosis than other PAN patients. Herein we report a patient with FMF and PAN who died of sepsis following a severe course of recurrent bleeding episodes which required multiple embolization attempts. The 39-year-old Turkish male presented with abdominal pain of 1-month duration. He had been diagnosed with FMF at the age of 24. On admission, he had pallor with general ill appearance. Rebound tenderness was obtained in the right upper abdominal quadrant. He had mild anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia. On the 2nd day of his admission, he developed hypotension with a rapid decline in hemoglobin level. Abdominal angiography showed multiple aneurysms in the branches of renal arteries, superior mesenteric artery, and hepatic arterial system including left renal infarct, suggesting PAN. He was put on high-dose steroids and oral cyclophosphamide. Despite medical treatment, he developed intense abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and a rapid fall in hemoglobin on four occasions. Active bleeding sites were embolized in two different angiography sessions. Although the patient experienced no more recurrent bleeding, he died of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome resulting from sepsis 6 weeks after admission. Polyarteritis nodosa associated with FMF may follow a grave course despite immunosuppressive therapy. Arterial embolization should be considered in the presence of bleeding aneurysms in addition to immunosuppressive therapy."
14675986,Medical management of first trimester miscarriage (blighted ovum and missed abortion): is it effective?,"This prospective study of 104 women investigated the dose-related efficacy of mifepristone combined with oral misoprostol in the management of first trimester miscarriage (missed abortion and blighted ovum). Forty-four women (group A) received 600 mg of oral mifepristone and 60 women (group B) received 200 mg of mifepristone, followed after 48 hours by oral misoprostol. Successful treatment was an empty uterus on scan and no bleeding after 10 days. This was achieved in 70.5% of group A and 66.7% of group B. Also studied were amount and time to cessation of bleeding, pain scores, analgesic requirements, adverse effects and infections. Of group A, 54.5% had heavy bleeding and bleeding stopped on average by 8 days. Median pain scores were 5.5 on a linear scale and 18% of women received intramuscular opiate analgesia. Adverse effects were nausea in 25% of women and diarrhoea in 16%. Of group B, 38.3% had heavy bleeding and bleeding stopped on average by 7 days. Median pain scores were 4.5 with 25% of women receiving intramuscular opiates. Nausea occurred in 7% of women and diarrhoea in 7%. We concluded that 200 mg of mifepristone and oral misoprostol is as effective and better tolerated than 600 mg mifepristone with oral misoprostol. Medical management of miscarriage is a valid option for those women seeking an alternative to traditional surgical management."
14620764,"Unprovoked periodontal hemorrhage, life-threatening anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura: an unusual case report.","Spontaneous gingival bleeding can occasionally be the only sign of systemic bleeding problems. The diagnosis and management of such conditions may challenge the skills of both the hematologist and the oral physician. We present this patient because of several confusing phenomena that were encountered: unprovoked periodontal hemorrhage, which endangered the life of an otherwise asymptomatic young adult male; (especially unusual was a platelet count above 150,000 cells per microliter of blood), and presentation of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura through spontaneous periodontal hemorrhage alone. This case history also highlights the fact that medical intervention to correct the underlying aberration of hemostasis is necessary for local dental measures to successfully stop bleeding. In contrast with the definition of thrombocytopenia, the ""within normal"" count of platelets should not exclude the possibility of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura; a fact that, if ignored, can make the diagnosis and management of bleeding troublesome."
12908384,[Cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle].,"Cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle is an uncommon disorder, not included under the accepted definitions of functional psychoses. We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder."

12803338,Pregnancy after mechanical mitral valve replacement.,"Forty-six pregnancies among 32 patients after mitral valve replacement (MVR) were reviewed. Prosthetic valve-related complications, and outcome of pregnancy including feto-maternal mortality and morbidity for different anticoagulation regimens are presented and discussed.
Among 521 women of fertile age undergoing MVR with a St. Jude Medical mechanical prosthesis, 32 patients developed a total of 46 pregnancies. Average patient follow up was 5 +/- 4 years (range: 10 months-17 years); total follow up was 155 patient years (pt-yr). Follow up commenced at onset of the first pregnancy.
Ten-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was 94 +/- 6%; 10-year freedom from valve-related events was 33 +/- 14%. Rates for embolism, anticoagulation-related bleeding and mechanical valve thrombosis were 4.5%, 3.2% and 2.6% per pt-yr, respectively. Among 30 patients receiving uninterrupted low-dose oral warfarin plus aspirin throughout pregnancy, three had normal deliveries, two had premature births, one had a low birth weight, seven had spontaneous abortions, and 17 had therapeutic abortions. By contrast, among eight patients who discontinued anticoagulation despite medical advice, seven had normal-term deliveries without thromboembolic complications, and spontaneous abortion occurred in one patient. Of the five women taking low molecular-weight heparin regimen, three had normal deliveries, one had a premature birth, and one an abortion. Two patients taking warfarin replaced by heparin in the first trimester and in the last two weeks, had term deliveries. One of these women developed left atrial thrombus in the third trimester while receiving heparin; after switching back to warfarin, the thrombus dissolved spontaneously. Another patient on heparin throughout the gestation had an uneventful gestation period that resulted in term delivery. There were four cases of prosthetic valve thrombosis during the postpartum period; all of these developed in women who ceased anticoagulation during pregnancy.
There were no congenital malformations or maternal mortality/morbidity during pregnancy in this series of 20 live births, probably due to the low-dose anticoagulation regimen used. However, anticoagulation cessation was associated with a high prosthetic valve thrombosis rate in the postpartum period, even when a new-generation prosthetic valve of unique design and expected low thrombogenicity was implanted."
12593592,Clinical and microbiologic study of periodontitis associated with Kindler syndrome.,"Little is known about the onset and prevalence of periodontal disease in patients with the rare Kindler syndrome, a genodermatological disorder. This study investigated the level of clinical periodontal attachment in relation to age and presence of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria in individuals with Kindler syndrome.
Eighteen individuals diagnosed with Kindler syndrome and 13 control subjects, aged 4 to 37 years, from rural Panama received a limited clinical periodontal examination. Subgingival samples were collected for identification of putative periodontal pathogens by polymerase chain reaction.
Mild to severe gingivitis was a common finding in all adults of the study population. Seventy-two percent (13/18) of the Kindler patients and 46% (6/13) of the control subjects showed mild to severe periodontal disease (P = 0.001, chi-square test). The onset of periodontitis was earlier and the progression occurred at a faster rate in the Kindler group. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.83) between the level of attachment loss and age in the Kindler group and a weaker correlation (r = 0.66) in the control group. The appearance of gingival tissues suggested atypical periodontitis with spontaneous bleeding and fragile, often desquamative, gingiva. In periodontitis patients, Porphyromonas gingivallis and Diallster pneumosintes tended to occur more frequently in control individuals compared to those with Kindler syndrome.
In the Kindler group, periodontitis had an onset in early teenage years and progressed more rapidly compared to non-Kindler individuals of the same geographic and ethnic group. Clinical and microbiological findings suggest atypical periodontitis in Kindler patients. We propose to include Kindler syndrome in the category of medical disorders predisposing to destructive periodontal disease."
12464809,Anticoagulant-related iliopsoas muscle bleeding leading to fatal exsanguination: report of two autopsy cases.,"Two cases of massive iliopsoas muscle bleeding leading to fatal exsanguination are presented. Both patients (two women, 61 and 74 years old, respectively) received oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. The intramuscular bleeding occurred spontaneously in women of relatively good physical condition. Intriguingly, phenprocoumon concentrations were within the therapeutic range (1.55 microg/ml and 1.26 microg/ml, respectively) as detected by toxicologic analysis. These cases demonstrate that severe bleeding in the iliopsoas muscle has to be considered in all patients receiving anticoagulant medication, even in those who have coagulation parameters within the therapeutic range. Especially in older patients with a high degree of comorbidity or in patients receiving analgesic drugs, the potential of fatal outcome of iliopsoas muscle bleeding seems to be of clinicopathologic relevance."
12408785,Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis.,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the prototypical ascitic fluid infection occurring in patients with advanced liver disease and ascites. The key to successful treatment of SBP is a knowledge of appropriate antibiotic regimens and an understanding of the setting in which infection develops, particularly those individuals at high risk for infection. A high index of suspicion should lead to early diagnostic paracentesis and ascitic fluid analysis. Treatment of SBP involves the use of non-nephrotoxic broad-spectrum antibiotics expected to cover the typical bacterial flora associated with SBP. SBP typically involves infection with a single organism, with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Streptococcus spp responsible for nearly three fourths of cases. The treatment of choice is cefotaxime 2 g given intravenously every 8 hours for a total of 5 days. The antibiotic regimen is adjusted based on the results of ascitic fluid cultures. Other antibiotic regimens for SBP are less well studied. Given the significant morbidity and mortality rates associated with SBP, efforts to prevent its development and recurrence with antibiotic prophylaxis are warranted. The most extensively studied form of prophylaxis involves selective intestinal decontamination (SID) with the oral fluoroquinolone norfloxacin. Individuals with low-protein ascites (ascitic fluid total protein < 1g/dL) benefit from SID with norfloxacin 400 mg daily during times of hospitalization. Long-term primary prophylaxis during outpatient management of individuals awaiting liver transplantation with severe ascites and advanced liver failure should also be considered. Patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding should receive norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily for 1 week following their bleed. Those individuals surviving an episode of SBP should be treated with norfloxacin 400 mg daily until the risk of SBP is removed by definitive resolution of the ascites or liver transplantation surgery. Although the infection-related mortality associated with SBP has decreased to less than 10%, hospitalization-related mortality remains as high as 30% as a result of the severe underlying liver disease in which the infection arises and the marked generation of cytokines and nitric oxide resulting from the infection. Recently, the simultaneous administration of intravenous albumin and antibiotics for SBP has been shown to result in the decreased development of azotemia and hospitalization-related mortality. Further improvement in the outcomes of SBP will require treatments targeting this cytokine cascade rather than the development of more potent antibiotics."
12383535,"Effect of oral misoprostol after second-trimester delivery: a randomized, blinded study.","To determine whether serial oral misoprostol shortens the third stage of labor in second-trimester pregnancy loss.
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of women between 13 and 28 weeks' gestation admitted for spontaneous or induced pregnancy termination. Subjects were randomized to receive either misoprostol (200 microg) or placebo orally every hour for a maximum of three doses if the placenta had not delivered spontaneously within 10 minutes of the fetus. A dilute oxytocin infusion was given to women in both groups. The patients were managed expectantly until intervention was required or up to 6 hours when curettage was scheduled.
One hundred eighteen women were randomized to misoprostol and 119 randomized to placebo. Fifty-eight (49%) and 55 (46%) of the misoprostol and placebo groups, respectively, did not receive their medication (P =.65, chi(2) test). There was no difference between the groups with regard to demographic features, method of pregnancy termination, or gestational age. Sixty-seven (57%) and 62 (52%) of the misoprostol and placebo groups, respectively, completed the third stage of labor within 2 hours (P =.47, chi(2) test). There was no statistically significant difference in the median time from fetus to placenta (60 versus 91 minutes in the misoprostol versus placebo group, P =.57, Mann-Whitney U test). There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of hemorrhage, need for transfusion, or curettage rate.
The therapeutic use of oral misoprostol in the third stage of labor in second-trimester pregnancy loss does not reduce the time to complete spontaneous placental delivery."
12139274,Spontaneous gingival haemorrhage: case report.,"Clinical observation of our patients forms the basis of the dental examination, along with other more complex diagnostic tests. In this case, the gingival bleeding episode of one patient was initially diagnosed and treated as an acute periodontal episode. When simple therapy failed to resolve the bleeding, a full haematological investigation was ordered. This revealed the presence of a life-threatening disease. The patient was immediately referred for medical management of acute myeloblastic leukaemia, but died some months later. Dentists should always be on guard to observe any unusual clinical signs that may lead to the early diagnosis of systemic disease processes."
12057782,Therapeutic use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system in women with menorrhagia: a pilot study(1).,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and performance, for up to 1 year, of an intrauterine system releasing 20 microg/day of levonorgestrel (LNG-IUS, Mirena) in the treatment of women with menorrhagia. It was a descriptive, prospective, non-comparative study. A 20 microg/day LNG-releasing-IUS was inserted on any day during bleeding to 44 women (between 24 and 49 years of age) who presented with menorrhagia after medical therapies had failed. Menstrual patterns were assessed, and hemoglobin concentrations were measured before LNG-IUS was inserted and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of use. The most common bleeding pattern at 3 months after insertion was spotting, and after 6, 9, and 12 months the majority of women presented with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. Three women requested removal of the LNG-IUS because of spotting, and six women expelled it spontaneously. Hemoglobin levels were improved from 102 g/L to 123 and 128 g/L at 3 and 12 months, respectively, after insertion of the LNG-IUS (p < 0.01). At 12 months 79.5% of participants continued the use of LNG-IUS. In conclusion, LNG-IUS was an effective treatment for three out of four women with menorrhagia and could be an alternative treatment for women with menorrhagia who are either contraindicated for or refuse hysterectomy or endometrial ablation."
11837714,Effect of carboxamide derivative IS-741 on rat spontaneous chronic pancreatitis.,"This study aimed to analyze the therapeutic effects of the carboxamide derivative IS-741 on spontaneous chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the WBN/Kob rat. Four-week-old male WBN/Kob rats were fed with MB-3, and IS-741 (0.012% in MB-3) was orally administered for 12 weeks. Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), interleukin (IL) -6, pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP), and p8 mRNAs in the pancreas were detected with semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Histological examination of the pancreas showed that hemorrhage, interstitial edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration were markedly less severe at 12 weeks, while fibrosis and acinar degeneration were also milder at 16 weeks, in the IS-741-treated rats than in untreated rats. The above-mentioned genes were significantly suppressed in IS-741-treated rats at 12 weeks. Our results show that IS-741 exerts a potentially therapeutic effect on experimental CP by suppressing the expressions of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and CINC) and pancreatic acute phase proteins (PAP and p8)."
11816265,Severe thrombocytopenia possibly associated with TMP/SMX therapy.,"To report a case of possible severe, life-threatening thrombocytopenia associated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) therapy.
A 54-year-old white woman received a 10-day course of TMP/SMX for treatment of chronic sinusitis. One day after finishing the course of TMP/SMX therapy, the presented to the emergency department because of the development of scattered petechiae on both hands and blood blisters in her mouth. On admission, her complete blood cell count results revealed a severely low platelet count of 2 x 10(3)/mm3. Other laboratory test results were normal, except for elevated blood glucose (nonfasting blood glucose). TMP/SMX was believed to be the most likely cause of thrombocytopenia. She was treated successfully with a transfusion of 2 units of platelets and oral prednisone. Her platelet count increased to 110 x 10(3)/mm3 4 days after discontinuation of TMP/SMX. She was discharged on hospital day 5. On follow-up (2 wk after hospital discharge), her platelet count was normal (351 x 10(3)/mm3).
TMP/SMX has been implicated as a cause of thrombocytopenia, which is defined as platelet count < 150 x 10(3)/mm3. Although it is uncommon, spontaneous severe bleeding may occur when platelet count decreases to < or = 10 x 10(3)/mm3. Thrombocytopenia associated with TMP/SMX appears to be an immune-mediated process resulting in platelet destruction by drug-dependent platelet antibodies. Treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with TMP/SMX therapy includes discontinuation of the offending drug and the use of corticosteroids. Platelet transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulin may be required in some patients.
Thrombocytopenia associated with TMP/SMX therapy can be serious or life threatening because it may result in significant bleeding complications. This hematologic adverse effect of TMP/SMX may occur even with the usual recommended dosage and duration of therapy. Careful monitoring of complete blood cell count, including platelet count, before and during TMP/SMX therapy is suggested."
11811747,"The physiology, medical management and oral implications of menopause.","Approximately 36 million women in the United States are in the postmenopausal phase of life. The vast majority of these women experienced spontaneous cessation of menses between the ages of 47 and 55 years when the production of estrogen decreased because of an inadequate number of functioning follicles within their ovaries. Fewer women entered menopause after surgical removal of both ovaries. This procedure usually is performed prophylactically to prevent ovarian cancer in conjunction with a hysterectomy, which is required to treat abnormal bleeding, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. The physiological changes associated with spontaneous or surgical menopause cause some women to experience uncomfortable symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. In addition, estrogen deprivation arising from menopause in association with age-related factors disproportionately increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (that is, myocardial infarct, stroke), osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease and oral disease. Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT (estrogen or estrogen and progestin), often is prescribed on a short-term basis to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency and on a long-term basis to prevent some of the chronic illnesses common to postmenopausal women.
Dentists who treat women entering menopause need to consider the stressful phase of life their patients are experiencing. Clinical findings of postmenopausal problems on dental examination may include a paucity of saliva, increased dental caries, dysesthesia, taste alterations, atrophic gingivitis, periodontitis and osteoporotic jaws unsuitable for conventional prosthetic devices or dental implants. Panoramic dental radiographs may reveal calcified carotid artery atheromas.
Dentists have an opportunity to refer women who are not under the care of a gynecologist for an evaluation to determine the appropriateness of HRT for its systemic and oral health benefits."
11709685,Oral manifestations in patients with aplastic anemia.,"The aim of the present study was to characterize the prevalence and risks of oral complications in aplastic anemia (AA).
Approximately 79 patients with AA (age, 37 +/- 17 years) and 66 control patients with schizophrenia (age, 33 +/- 12 years) were examined. Records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and radiographic information. Prior medical therapy, laboratory values, disease duration, and medical treatment response were noted for patients with AA. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for oral manifestations in cases and in control subjects. Univariate analysis identified important variables for logistic regression.
Patients with AA presented more frequently with oral petechiae (OR = 49; 95% CI, 2.9-825), gingival hyperplasia (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5), spontaneous gingival bleeding (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5), and herpetic lesions (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5). Prior cyclosporine use was associated with gingival hyperplasia (P =.0001). No other predictors for oral manifestations or treatment outcomes were found.
Oral soft tissue changes and infections were more common in patients with AA. Prior cyclosporine use was predictive of the presence of gingival hyperplasia."
11692018,Management and prognostic features of intracerebral hemorrhage during anticoagulant therapy: a Swedish multicenter study.,"Patients treated with oral anticoagulants (ACs) have an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is more often fatal than spontaneous ICH. Options to reverse the AC effect include intravenous administration of vitamin K, plasma, and coagulation factor concentrate. However, the optimal management of AC-related ICH has not been determined in any randomized trial. In this study, the present management of AC-related ICH was surveyed, and determinants of survival were assessed.
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all AC-related ICHs at 10 Swedish hospitals during a 4-year period, 1993 to 1996. Survival status after the ICH was determined from the Swedish National population register.
We identified 151 patients with AC-related ICH. Death rates were 53.6% at 30 days, 63.6% at 6 months, and 77.5% at follow-up (mean 3.5 years). The case fatality ratio at 30 days was 96% among patients unconscious on admission (n=27), 80% among patients who became unconscious before active treatment was started (n=15), 55% among patients in whom no special action was taken except withdrawal of AC treatment (n=42), and 28% among patients given active anti-coumarin treatment while they were still conscious (n=64). The case fatality ratio at 30 days was 11% in the group treated with plasma (n=18), 30% in the group treated with vitamin K (n=23), and 39% in the group treated with coagulation factor concentrate (n=23). Within the first 24 to 48 hours after admission, 47% of the patients deteriorated. Choice of therapy to reverse the AC effect differed substantially between the hospitals (P<0.0001), as did the time interval from symptom onset to start of treatment. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed only 2 factors (intraventricular extension of bleeding and ICH volume) that were independently related to case fatality at both 30 days and 6 months. The results were similar when the analysis was restricted to patients who were conscious on admission.
In AC-related ICH, a progressive neurological deterioration during the first 24 to 48 hours after admission is frequent, and the mortality is high. Choice of therapy to reverse the AC effect differed considerably between the hospitals. There was no evidence that any treatment strategy was superior to the others. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine the best choice of treatment."
11198768,Prothrombin complex concentrate for oral anticoagulant reversal in neurosurgical emergencies.,"The incidence of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage has increased markedly in line with the increased use of oral anticoagulant agents. Recent guidelines for reversal of this acquired coagulation defect in an emergency have been established, but they are not adhered to in all centres. Our unit is referred between 20 and 60 patients per year (1994-1999) who are anticoagulated and require urgent neurosurgical intervention. In order to investigate this, we performed a prospective study using prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). PCC was given to the first six patients with intracranial haemorrhage admitted to the neurosurgical unit requiring urgent correction of anticoagulation (Group 1) and compared with patients receiving standard treatment with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K (Group 2). Mean International Normalised Ratios of Group 1 were 4.86 pretreatment and 1.32 posttreatment, and of Group 2 were 5.32 and 2.30, respectively. Results for complete reversal and reversal time were significant for PCC with p < 0.001. We recommend PCC for rapid and effective reversal of warfarin in life-threatening neurosurgical emergencies."
11130121,[Superior vena cava thrombosis after in vitro fertilization].,"A 29-year-old female was admitted with the diagnosis of multiple deep vein thrombosis of the upper limbs and neck and pneumonia secondary to pulmonary embolism on the right side. Medical history revealed that in vitro fertilization with hormone stimulation had been carried out 5 weeks before. For ten days the patient had noticed a growing, painful swelling on the right side of her neck accompanied by difficulties in swallowing. Since this time she had experienced episodes of shortness of breath without chest pain. Clinical findings showed a soft and slightly painful swelling of the right side of the neck without dyspnoea or cyanosis at rest. Breath sounds were decreased over the right lower lung on auscultation.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed complete obstruction of the subclavian and brachiocephalic vein on the right side and clots in the superior vena cava, left subclavian vein, bilateral internal jugular veins and the right axillar vein. Chest x-ray showed pleural effusion on the right side.
As the seven-week pregnancy was found not to be viable anymore, fibinolysis with streptokinase was started under protection of a temporary cava filter. During the following hours the patient developed serious bleeding as a complication of this therapy and fibrinolysis had to be discontinued after 16 hours. In subsequent examinations the obstruction of the left internal jugular vein was unchanged but collaterals around the obstruction were noticed. The other veins affected were open, some with reduced flow. Several risk factors were found in the history of the patient such as smoking, immobilization, a positive family history, protein S deficiency and APC resistance. After 3 weeks of hospital therapy the patient was discharged under oral anticoagulation with coumarin.
In vitro fertilization with hormonal stimulation may cause serious complications in patients with unknown coagulation disorders or with an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Risk factors for thromboembolism need to be ruled out carefully before starting the procedure."
11084175,Hormone replacement therapy: effect of progestin dose and time since menopause on endometrial bleeding.,"To analyze the effects of two continuous combined hormone replacement regimens on bleeding profiles in postmenopausal women, based on progestin dose and time since the patient's last spontaneous menstrual period.
A randomized, double-masked, multicenter trial was conducted in 1724 women recruited from 99 sites. Six hundred seventy-eight women received a continuous regimen of oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/day, combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 or 5.0 mg/day, for 1 year.
After 1 year, no bleeding was reported by over 89% of women. More women in the 5.0 mg/day MPA group than in the 2.5 mg/day MPA group reported no bleeding (93.8% versus 89.5%; P<.089). Of those women who had had their last menstrual period 3 years ago or less, a significantly higher percentage in the 5.0 mg/day MPA group (72.4%) did not experience bleeding after three cycles compared with the 2.5 mg group (59.0%; P<.001). Although the percentage of patients without bleeding was also higher in the 5.0 mg/day MPA group after six cycles and 1 year, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Of the women who had their last menstrual period more than 3 years ago, 94.7% of those in the 5.0 mg/day MPA group and 90.7% of those in the 2.5 mg/day MPA group reported no bleeding at 1 year.
A continuous combined regimen of CEE plus 5.0 mg MPA may be more suitable for women closer to the onset of menopause or for women starting therapy who are unwilling to tolerate irregular bleeding. The improved bleeding profile with CEE and 5.0 mg/day MPA is likely to enhance compliance with hormone replacement therapy."
11034679,Antifibrinolytics for heavy menstrual bleeding.,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in women. Medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery, is an attractive treatment option. A wide variety of medications are available to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding but there is considerable variation in practice and uncertainty about the most appropriate therapy. Plasminogen activators are a group of enzymes that cause fibrinolysis (the dissolution of clots). An increase in the levels of plasminogen activators has been found in the endometrium of women with heavy menstrual bleeding compared to those with normal menstrual loss. Plasminogen activator inhibitors (antifibrinolytic agents) have therefore been promoted as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. There has been a reluctance to prescribe tranexamic acid due to possible side effects of the drugs such as an increased risk of thrombogenic disease (deep venous thrombosis). Long term studies in Sweden, however, have shown that the rate of incidence of thrombosis in women treated with tranexamic acid is comparable with the spontaneous frequency of thrombosis in women.
To determine the effectiveness of antifibrinolytics in achieving a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding.
All studies which might describe randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytic therapy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding were obtained by electronic searches of MEDLINE 1966-1997, EMBASE 1980-1997 and the Cochrane Library. Companies producing antifibrinolytics and experts within the field were contacted for reference lists and information on unpublished trials.
Randomised controlled trials in women of reproductive age treated with antifibrinolytic agents versus placebo, no treatment or any other medical (non-surgical) therapy for regular heavy menstrual bleeding within either the primary, family planning or specialist clinic settings. Women with post menopausal bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, iatrogenic or pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were excluded.
Fifteen eligible trials were assessed by three reviewers and eight of these did not meet with the inclusion criteria. Of the seven remaining trials, four of these could be included within the meta-analysis. The remaining three trials had a crossover design and despite contacting the authors and appropriate companies, we were unable to extract the results in a format suitable to include these within the meta-analysis. However the results are included within the text of the review for discussion.
Antifibrinolytic therapy compared to placebo showed a significant reduction in mean blood loss (WMD -94.0 [-151.4, -36.5]) and significant change in mean reduction of blood loss (WMD -110.2 [-146.5, -73.8]). This objective improvement was not mirrored by a patient perceived improvement in monthly menstrual blood loss (RR 2.5 [0.9, 7.3]) in the one study which recorded this outcome (~~ Edlund 1995~~). Antifibrinolytic agents were compared to only three other medical (non-surgical) therapies: mefenamic acid, norethisterone administered in the luteal phase and ethamsylate. In all instances, there was a significant reduction in mean blood loss (WMD -73.0 [-123.4, -22.6], WMD -111.0 [-178.5, -43.5] and (WMD -100 [-143.9, -56.1] respectively) and a strong, although non-significant trend in favour of tranexamic acid in the participants' perception of an improvement in menstrual blood loss. There were no significant differences in the frequency of reported side effects with tranexamic acid when compared to oral luteal phase progestogens (RR 0.4 [0.1, 1.2]) or withdrawal from treatment because of adverse events when compared with NSAIDs and ethamsylate when these treatments were used for heavy menstrual bleeding. Change in the quality of life measures, flooding and leakage and sex life, were significantly improved in the tranexamic acid group when compared to the oral progestagen group. These findings are based in most cases on only one trial.
Antifibrinolytic therapy causes a greater reduction in objective measurements of heavy menstrual bleeding when compared to placebo or other medical therapies (NSAIDS, oral luteal phase progestagens and ethamsylate). This treatment is not associated with an increase in side effects compared to placebo, NSAIDS, oral luteal phase progestagens or ethamsylate. Flooding and leakage and sex life is significantly improved after tranexamic acid therapy when compared with oral luteal progestogens but no other measures of quality of life were assessed. No study has used resource cost as an outcome. There are no data available within randomised controlled trials which record the frequency of thromboembolic events."

10791483,"""What can I do to enhance the development of a premature infant with chronic lung disease?"".","CASE. Timmy was born at 32 weeks of gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy until there was a spontaneous rupture of the membranes and preterm labor associated with chorioamnionitis. A 2-month hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was associated with pneumonia, a Grade II intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, and a slow weight gain in the nursery. He was discharged to home with plans for ongoing care by his pediatrician. The primary care pediatrician attended a multidisciplinary conference with the NICU staff and Timmy's parents. At the time of discharge from the nursery, at 38 weeks postconceptual age, Timmy still required oral diuretics and supplemental oxygen, as well as other medications such as iron. Timmy's respiratory rates were between 40 and 60 breaths per minute at rest, with mild intercostal retractions. He was discharged with a cardiorespiratory monitor. The discharge examination revealed mild to moderate symmetrical hypotonia with intact deep tendon reflexes, shoulder girdle weakness, and a mild head lag. Timmy would regard a human face and a bright object and would follow them briefly. He became active and would thrash his extremities with minimal tactile, bright light, or auditory stimulation. Typically, he settled slowly with swaddling and a pacifier. Nursing was slow to develop; he was currently receiving one half of his calories at the breast and the remainder of his calories from bottle-feeding of fortified expressed breast milk. As she prepared for the first office visit with Timmy and his parents, the pediatrician asked herself, ""What can I do to enhance the developmental outcome for this child?"""

The authors describe a unique case of a clonal proliferation of CD8+ T cells involving the oral mucosa, ileum, and colon of a 35-year-old man that has regressed spontaneously and recurred numerous times over a 9-year period without treatment. The patient's symptoms were limited to occasional rectal bleeding and recurring painful oral ulcers. Within the intestine, these collections of small T cells induced minimal architectural distortions and did not show extensive epitheliotrophism. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses revealed that the identical T-cell clone has been present for more than 9 years and in different mucosal locations in this patient. This may represent a unique T-cell lymphoproliferative process akin to a mucosal counterpart of lymphomatoid papulosis of the skin."
10511035,"Oral cimetidine (Tagamet) for recalcitrant, diffuse conjunctival papillomatosis.","To report the efficacy of cimetidine for treatment of conjunctival papillomatosis.
An 11-year-old boy had an 8-year history of diffuse conjunctival papillomas, treated previously with standard measures of excisional biopsy and cryotherapy. He developed spontaneous conjunctival bleeding and diffuse tumor recurrence over the entire conjunctival surface. Oral cimetidine liquid (30 mg/kg/day) was prescribed.
Within 2 months, dramatic tumor regression was noted, with nearly complete resolution by 4 months. The patient had no local or systemic side effects from the medication.
Oral cimetidine possesses immune modulation properties and may be useful in some cases of virus-induced conjunctival papillomatosis."
10461777,Intracranial hemorrhage in an infant owing to vitamin K deficiency despite prophylaxis.,"A 3-month-old male infant with intracranial hemorrhage attributable to a vitamin K deficiency is reported. Vitamin K2 was administered orally at birth and then at 5 days and I month of age. Oral antibiotics were also given 2 days before the onset of bleeding. Although the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage resulting from vitamin K deficiency has decreased since the introduction of vitamin K2 prophylaxis, spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages are still being reported in infants. We suggest that vitamin K prophylaxis is needed especially for breast-fed infants and for those undergoing antibiotic therapy."
10453830,Randomised trial comparing expectant with medical management for first trimester miscarriages.,"To compare the efficacy of antiprogesterone (mifepristone) in combination with a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue (misoprostol) for outpatient treatment of miscarriages.
One hundred and twenty-two women with first trimester miscarriages.
The women were randomised to treatment with mifepristone 400 mg orally followed by a single oral dose of 400 microg misoprostol 48 hours later (n = 60) or expectant management (n = 62). Women were re-evaluated five days later. If retained intrauterine products of conception were found with an antero-posterior diameter above 15 mm on transvaginal ultrasound, surgical evacuation was performed.
Eighty-two percent of the women randomised to pharmacological treatment and 76% of those randomised to expectant management had an empty uterine cavity after five days. Convalescence time was 1.8 days longer for women randomised to pharmacological treatment. Pain, bleeding, complications, and satisfaction with the treatment did not differ between the groups.
Most cases of spontaneous incomplete miscarriage will become a complete miscarriage without intervention. This study shows that outpatient treatment with a combination of antiprogesterone and a prostaglandin E1 analogue did not increase the rate of complete miscarriage, compared with expectancy alone, by a clinical important degree."
10068757,[Spontaneous hemorrhage in liver neoplasms. Experience at an institution].,"Retrospective review of a single Institution experience with the management of hepatic neoplasms complicated with spontaneous bleeding.
In a 11 years period from 1980 to 1990 we reviewed the medical charts of patients treated at our Institution with the diagnosis of hepatic neoplasms complicated with sudden bleeding. We recorded demographic information, clinical manifestations, treatment and outcome. A review of the world literature was done.
We found six patients with the diagnosis of liver tumors complicated with sudden bleeding. Five patients were female with a age range from 30 to 67 years old. Four of them had an adenoma (three of them single and one multiple) and the fifth had a non-parasitic cyst. Seventy-five per cent of the patients with the diagnosis of adenoma had used in the past oral contraceptives for at least three years. The sixth patient was a male with a ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma. Three patients were admitted in shock. Successful transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization was performed in two patients; the third required operative hemostasis. Major hepatic resections were performed in three patients including a total hepatectomy and liver transplant. All patients recovered satisfactorily.
The spontaneous rupture of benign and malignant tumors of the liver is not a common phenomenon, but is a serious complication. The experience of our Institution and the reports of literature favor CT scan and arteriogram as the most effective diagnostic methods in this group of patients, but arteriogram has the advantage of its therapeutic potential. The long term prognosis of this patients depends of their pathological diagnosis."
9424976,The incidence of venous thromboembolism in family members of patients with factor V Leiden mutation and venous thrombosis.,"The factor V Leiden mutation is a genetic defect associated with an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism. When the incidence of venous thromboembolism in relatives of patients known to have the mutation outweighs the disadvantages of prophylactic strategies, family screening may be necessary.
To determine the incidence of venous thromboembolism in first-degree relatives of symptomatic carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation.
Retrospective blinded study.
University hospitals.
437 first-degree relatives of 112 heterozygous propositi and 30 relatives of 6 homozygous propositi.
Before DNA testing, information on previous venous thromboembolism and concomitant risk factors was obtained. Relatives with and without the FV: Q506 mutation were compared.
The annual incidence of thromboembolism in relatives of heterozygous propositi was 0.45% (95% CI, 0.28% to 0.61%) in those with the mutation and 0.10% (CI, 0.02% to 0.19%) in those without the mutation (relative risk, 4.2 [CI, 1.8 to 9.9]). Among carriers, the incidence increased from 0.25% (CI, 0.12% to 0.49%) in the 15- to 30-year-old age group to 1.1% (CI, 0.24% to 3.33%) in persons older than 60 years of age. Half of the episodes of venous thromboembolism occurred spontaneously, 20% were related to surgery, and 30% were associated with pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives.
The observed low annual risk for venous thromboembolism in persons carrying the factor V Leiden mutation does not seem to outweigh the risks for bleeding associated with coumarin prophylaxis or justify discouragement of the use of oral contraceptives. A general policy of screening the families of all patients with the factor V Leiden mutation does not seem to be indicated. The observations in this moderate-size, retrospective study need to be confirmed by prospective follow-up studies."
9307543,Unsuccessful treatment of missed abortion with a combination of an antiprogesterone and a prostaglandin E1 analogue.,"In a prospective clinical trial the effectiveness of a combination of 400 mg of mifepristone (antiprogesterone) and 400 g misoprostol (synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue), both taken orally, was evaluated for the treatment of missed abortion. Of the 31 patients included, 16 (52%) had an empty uterine cavity at follow up six days after inclusion, 11 (35%) required surgical evacuation for retained intrauterine products of conception found at follow up, and four (13%) required emergency surgical evacuation due to severe pain or bleeding. The results do not support the use of mifepristone and misoprostol for women wishing the miscarriage to be resolved quickly.
A prospective clinical trial involving 31 Swedish women failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a combination of 400 mg of mifepristone and 400 g of misoprostol for the treatment of missed spontaneous abortion. Transvaginal ultrasound examination showed intrauterine products of conception with an antero-posterior diameter of 15-50 mm in all study participants. 6 days after treatment, only 16 women (52%) had an empty uterine cavity. Surgical evacuation was required in the remaining 15 women, 11 because of retained products of conception (mean diameter, 26.7 mm). An additional 4 women underwent emergency surgical evacuation due to severe pain or bleeding. Women who successfully aborted after treatment had a significantly greater number of prior pregnancies than women who failed to abort. There were no differences between groups, however, in gestational length, size of the pregnancy products, or serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone. These results do not support the use of mifepristone and misoprostol for pharmacologic treatment in women who want their spontaneous abortions to be resolved quickly."
9302393,Increased number of IGF-I receptors on erythrocytes of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"To test the hypothesis that insulin acts though ovarian IGF-I receptors to produce excessive amounts of androgens in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), by measuring the binding capacity of IGF-I receptors on erythrocytes and relating the findings to the degree of hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinaemia.
A case-control study of IGF-I receptors on erythrocytes of women with PCOS and age- and weight-matched controls.
IGF-I receptors on erythrocytes, serum levels of androgens, IGF-I, GH, basal insulin and insulin response during oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) were measured after induced or spontaneous withdrawal bleeding in 10 women with PCOS and eight normo-ovulatory women.
An increased number of IGF-I receptors was found on erythrocytes of patients with PCOS compared with the controls (P < 0.01), irrespective of their body mass index. Serum IGF-I levels were similar in both groups. The degree of hyperinsulinaemia, provoked by oGTT, correlated positively with basal insulin (r = 0.69; P = 0.003), but not with the number of IGF-I receptors. However, the number of IGF-I receptors correlated positively with androstenedione (r = 0.54, P = 0.0018).
The findings in the present study that the number of IGF-I receptors and not the insulin levels correlate with serum androstenedione support the theory that the hyperandrogenism in PCOS is not a direct effect of the hyperinsulinaemia, but IGF-I mediated."
9251305,[Multiple myeloma with oral manifestations--report of two cases].,"Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic disorder of bone that originates from cells of bone marrow. It is most commonly seen within the age range of 50-80 years, cases under the age of 40 being rare. Men are affected more frequently than are women. Bone pain is the cardinal clinical symptom in multiple myeloma. Because of the destruction of bone, pathologic fracture is fairly common. In the oral manifestations, the mandible is involved far more frequently than the maxilla, especially the most active hematopoietic areas-the remus, angle and molar region of the mandible. Other signs and symptoms of jaw involvement include swelling, pain, and increased tooth mobility. Extraosseous lesions may result in paresthesia of soft tissue and gingival enlargement with bleeding tendency. Roentgenographic examination will usually reveal numerous punched-out lesions in a variety of bones. In addition, blood examination will reveal hyperglobulinemia and Bence-Jones protein may be present in the urine of myeloma patients. The histological features of myeloma are closely packed cells resembling plasma cells. Case 1 in this report is a 64-year-old female, who has been diagnosed as having multiple myeloma (IgG, lambda). She was referred to our hospital because of gingival swelling, bleeding and pain. Case 2 is a 60-year-old female suffering from spontaneous gingival bleeding. After blood, urine examination and bone marrow biopsy, multiple myeloma was diagnosed (IgG, lambda). This paper reports the clinical manifestations and treatment courses of these two cases, and the concerns of treatment of multiple myeloma are also discussed."
9219124,Severe bleeding from a pregnancy tumor. A case report.,"Hyperplastic gingivitis and gingival hyperplasia accompanying gestation have been termed ""pregnancy gingivitis"" and ""pregnancy tumor."" The condition is benign but, rarely, is complicated by severe bleeding that is difficult to manage. A single case of a pregnancy tumor is reported.
A 28-year-old woman in the third trimester was evaluated for treatment of a pregnancy granuloma with recurrent episodes of severe bleeding for two weeks. Conservative management by firm pressure on gauze packs was applied to control the bleeding, but in vain. Induction of labor was conducted at 37 weeks partially because of term pregnancy and uncontrollable bleeding from the gingiva. An emergency cesarean section was done because of acute fetal distress during induction of labor. A healthy infant was delivered. The gingival bleeding stopped spontaneously five days afterwards. The patient was given thorough dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene instructions. The buccal granulomatous tumor was decreased in size four weeks postpartum.
Careful oral dental hygiene, removal of dental plaque and debris, and use of soft toothbrushes are important during pregnancy to avoid occurrence of a pregnancy tumor. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, management should be based on the individual condition and should range from supportive therapy--such as desiccation of bleeders; local, firm compression and oral hygiene to blood transfusion--as well as medication to accelerate fetal lung maturity or even termination of pregnancy to save the patient's life, as with treatment of uncontrollable eclampsia."
9456644,Analysis of oral manifestations of leukemia: a retrospective study.,"To evaluate in detail the oral complications of leukemia at initial presentation. Associations between oral manifestations and laboratory data were also investigated.
A retrospective study of 230 cases was conducted to investigate the nature and incidence of oral manifestations at initial presentation. The following data were determined for each patient: age, sex, haemogram at diagnosis (which included haemoglobin, red blood cell counts, differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts), classification of the type of leukemia's systemic symptoms and oral manifestations at the initial physical examination including the dental consultation.
It was revealed that the type of leukemia diagnosed, except with CML, is related to the age prediliction of patients. The incidence of leukemia is higher in males than in females. The most common manifestations of leukemia are lymphadenopathy (71.4% in ALL; 45% in AML), laryngeal pain (52.7% in ALL; 37.3% in AML), gingival bleeding (43.2% in AML; 28.6% in ALL), oral ulceration, and gingival enlargement. Fever (92.2%) was the most common symptom in patients with all types of leukemia. Platelet counts from 25,000 mm-3 to 60,000 mm-3 are at sufficiently low levels to result in spontaneous bleeding. Most of the patients had WBC counts of greater than 10,000 mm-3. Only 12.6% of patients had normal WBC counts.
It was concluded that the age prediliction and prevalence of oral manifestations are closely related to the type of leukemia."
10639272,Low-Dose Vitamin K Therapy in Excessively Anticoagulated Patients: A Dose-Finding Study.,"Rapid reduction of excessively high international normalized ratio (INR) values into the therapeutic range is necessary in patients who must be maintained on oral anticoagulants but who present with an overdose. We prospectively studied the effect of observation alone versus escalating low doses of intravenous vitamin K on 23 patients presenting with no overt evidence of hemorrhage and INR values in excess of 10. Two of six patients observed without intervention developed spontaneous hemorrhage. Only one of the observed patients and none of 4 patients given 100-200 µg-vitamin K had INR values less than 5.0 by 24 hours. Three of the four patients receiving 500 µg of vitamin K had INR values less than 5.0, with two of these being less than 3.5 within the first 24 hours. Nine patients receiving 1000 µg of vitamin K had INR values between 1.7 and 3.5 by 24 hours. In none of these nine patients did the INR subsequently normalize, and there were no difficulties re-establishing anticoagulant therapy. No adverse effects were noted in any of the patients receiving intravenous vitamin K. We recommend 1000 µg of intravenous vitamin K as a safe and effective means of rapidly reversing excessively anticoagulated patients presenting with INR values greater than 10 units."
9746672,Treatment Decisions in the Management of Menorrhagia.,"Menorrhagia--menstrual periods lasting longer than 7 days and totaling blood losses greater than 80mL--affects 9%-14% of otherwise healthy women, and it can signal cancer, an endocrinologic disorder, or gynecologic disease. Blood loss can be high enough to result in anemia, fatigue, and syncope. Most often, abnormal uterine bleeding such as menorrhagia involves a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the ovary, and/or the uterus. Other identified causes include medications (especially psychotropics) that cross the blood-brain barrier; chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and liver and kidney dysfunction; endocrine disorders, perimenopausal anovulation, polycystic ovary disease, pituitary tumors, and abnormal estrogen cycling caused by morbid obesity; and anatomic abnormalities of the uterus. Routine tests include hematocrit or hemoglobin to detect and evaluate anemia, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level to evaluate thyroid function as a possible cause, and a pregnancy test to rule out an incomplete, spontaneous abortion as a cause. A Pap test is recommended to screen for dysplasia that can suggest a gynecologic cancer cause. Additional screening for endocrine disorders that may be causing menorrhagia include tests of thyroid, liver, and kidney function, and tests of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, and cortisol levels. Treatment can be medical or surgical. Medical treatment includes prostaglandin inhibitors, specifically nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and hormonal therapy with estrogen, progesterone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, or oral contraceptives such as medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera). Surgical treatment includes hysteroscopic endometrial ablation by physical agents, laser electrodiathermy, and ""roller ball,"" or surgical, resection. Hysterectomy is the treatment of last resort."
8971650,The effect of ketoprofen creams on periodontal disease in rhesus monkeys.,"Ketoprofen creams were evaluated for the treatment of periodontal disease in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in the rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta. Two formulations containing ketoprofen (1%), with or without vitamin E, were evaluated against appropriate controls (8 monkeys per group). Two weeks prior to treatment, the animals received prophylaxis on only the left side of the mouth (spontaneous model). Selected teeth on the right side of the mouth were ligated (ligature model). The creams were administered to the gingiva once daily at a standard dose of 1.8 ml per monkey for 6 months. Clinical assessments were made 2 wk before initiation, at baseline and 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-treatment. The clinical parameters included plaque formation, gingival redness, edema, bleeding on probing and Ramfjord Attachment Level measurements (RAL). Radiographs were taken at 2 wk before initiation, baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Digital, subtraction radiography was used to measure vertical linear bone loss along the interproximal root surfaces of the left and right mandibular first molars. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was collected for biochemical assays on PGE2, TxB2, LTB4, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. There were no significant differences among groups with respect to gingival indices. Radiographic data demonstrated significant positive effects on bone activity in both groups treated with ketoprofen formulations with improvement over time in the ligature model (0.01 < or = p < or = 0.04). The placebo group exhibited bone loss of 1.96 +/- 0.48 and 1.40 +/- 0.56 mm per site at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The group treated with ketoprofen cream showed an apparent bone gain of 0.28 +/- 0.41 and 0.78 +/- 0.47 mm per site at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The group treated with ketoprofen cream containing vitamin E showed a mean bone loss of 0.41-0.48 mm per site at 3 months with improvement to an apparent bone gain of 0.31 +/- 0.44 mm per site at 6 months. The biochemical data demonstrated early and significant suppression of GCF-LTB4 by both ketoprofen formulations at 1 month, which preceded the significant suppression of GCF-PGE2 at 2 and 3 months in the ligature model (p < 0.003) and at 2 to 6 months in the spontaneous model (p < 0.02). We conclude that ketoprofen at 1% level in suitable topical vehicles can effectively inhibit GCF-LTB4 and GCF-PGE2 and positively alter alveolar bone activity in the ligature-induced model of periodontitis in the monkey."
8842582,Shorter pill-free interval in combined oral contraceptives decreases follicular development.,"The objective of the study was to determine the suppressive effect on ovarian activity of 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol plus 75 micrograms gestodene administered for 21 or 23 days. The study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial in 60 women. A pre-treatment cycle, three treatment cycles and a post-treatment period were monitored by ovarian ultrasound and by LH, FSH, 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone measurements every other day. No ovulation and no luteinized, unruptured follicle were observed. Suppression of ovarian activity was more pronounced by the 23-day regimen. 17 beta-Estradiol serum levels during the last six days of a cycle and during the first six days of the next cycle were significantly less (p < 0.05) in the 23-day regimen. The superiority of the 23-day regimen in comparison to the 21-day regimen with regard to the suppression of ovarian activity was shown in this study. The observed differences in the 17 beta-estradiol levels and follicular development between a 21-day and 23-day preparation combine to suggest that shortening the pill-free interval in combined oral contraceptives may increase the contraceptive safety margin in women on low-dose formulations.
The objective of a double-blind randomized multicenter trial enrolling 60 women was to determine the suppressive effect on ovarian activity of 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 75 mcg gestodene administered for 21 or 23 days. The sites were at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Manchester, UK, and the Institute for Sterility Treatment, Vienna, Austria. The 60 women were healthy volunteers 19-35 years old, and they were randomized with 30 subjects each entering the treatment phase for either the 21-day regimen or the 23-day regimen. A pre-treatment cycle, 3 treatment cycles, and a post-treatment period were monitored by ovarian ultrasound and by measurements of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), 17-beta-estradiol, and progesterone every other day. Two women on the 21-day regimen forgot to take 1 pill each. Side effects were minor including breast tension, vomiting, nausea, acne, and weight loss or weight gain. Withdrawal bleeding commenced in the 23-day group 2 days later than in the 21-day group. The frequency of intracyclic bleeding decreased when progressing from treatment cycle 1 to 3. No ovulation and no luteinized, unruptured follicle were observed. After stopping the medication, spontaneous ovulations were observed in all volunteers in the 23-day regimen. Suppression of ovarian activity was more pronounced in the 23-day regimen. 17-beta-estradiol serum levels during the last 6 days of a cycle and during the first 6 days of the next cycle were significantly less (p 0.05) in the 23-day regimen. The superiority of the 23-day regimen in comparison to the 21-day regimen with regard to the suppression of ovarian activity was shown. The observed differences in the 17-beta-estradiol levels and follicular development between the 21-day and 23-day preparations suggest that shortening the pill-free interval in combined oral contraceptives may increase the contraceptive safety margin in women on low-dose formulations."

Case report.
Municipal hospital.
A spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma developed at the thoracic level in a 62-year-old man in association with cocaine use. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data are presented.
The patient was treated medically with intravenous and oral dexamethasone sodium phosphate. His neurologic status gradually improved during a 12-day hospitalization.
Cocaine use should be considered in the evaluation of spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhage."
8755752,Surgical outcome after repeated transsphenoidal surgery in acromegaly.,"Transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy is the most efficient primary treatment for acromegaly. However, management of persistent or recurrent disease remains controversial. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the early and long-term efficacy and safety of a second transsphenoidal surgery performed in those cases. The results of a retrospective study of 16 patients undergoing reoperation by the senior author (J.H.) between 1970 and 1991 are reported. Reoperation was performed for persistent or progressive acromegaly in 11 patients, visual impairment in four, and disease recurrence in one. Normalization of growth hormone (GH) was defined as a basal GH level of less than 5 micrograms/L and suppression to less than 2 micrograms/L during the oral glucose tolerance test. Long-term follow-up data were available in 15 patients. The second transsphenoidal surgery induced a greater than 50% decrease of GH level in 11 patients. Three (19%) of 16 patients were cured according to the authors' criteria and remained so after 2, 7, and 20 years. Two more patients had a postoperative basal GH level of less than 5 micrograms/L but incomplete suppression during the oral glucose tolerance test. Thus, a total of five patients (31%) achieved a basal GH of less than 5 micrograms/L. One other patient who had no initial improvement after the second transphenoidal surgery had spontaneous normalization of his GH level after 13 years. The following complications of the second surgery occurred in three patients: one subarachnoid hemorrhage, two new visual field defects, one cranial nerve palsy, and one meningitis. Moreover, 10 patients (62.5%) developed one or more new pituitary hormone deficiencies. In conclusion, reoperation for persistent or recurrent acromegaly has low success and high complication rates. According to the authors' experience, this procedure should be reserved for patients unresponsive to other forms of therapy or with progressive visual impairment despite medical therapy."
8732468,HRT management: the American experience.,"To review the history, current clinical practice, choice of methods and number of prescriptions and sales of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the US.
Literature review, survey data collection, sales and prescription data.
The number of women currently utilizing HRT is greater in women aged 40-60 (35%) but falls with advancing age greater than 65 (15%) and declines further in women greater than 80 (7%). News media and physicians represent the largest source of information used by US women for information regarding HRT. Obstetricians and gynecologists currently are the predominant physicians prescribing HRT, but in the future, family practitioners and paramedical workers will prescribe HRT. Women who spontaneously develop menopause early and younger women undergoing castration are more likely to take transdermal estrogen. However, the majority of prescriptions in the US are oral estrogens (86% of the market). The market leader of oral estrogens in the US are conjugated equine estrogens (70%). Fifty percent of prescriptions in women with a uterus consist of combined continuous estrogen and progestogen whereas as 42% consist of cyclic estrogen and progestogen.
It appears that although there is an increase in HRT use by postmenopausal women in the US, the actual percentage of current users remains lower than anticipated. This occurred in spite of widespread media and educational efforts of benefits of HRT. Many women still fear the risk of breast and uterine cancer as well as the side effects of estrogen (primarily bleeding) which reduces the number of women currently taking estrogen. A number of surveys suggested that most women receive their information from the media and an equal amount from their physicians. With respect to estrogen use alone the majority of prescriptions are written for women without a uterus. Transdermal estrogens are used more commonly in women in the early postmenopausal period. In women with a uterus, most US physicians prescribe a combination of estrogen plus a progestogen, but when they do they utilize oral estrogen rather than transdermal estrogen."
8735356,The perimenopause and contraception.,"To review the implications of pregnancy in women in their forties and the contraceptive options open to them.
Medline and popline reviews of the literature.
Women in their forties are still potentially fertile, and pregnancy in this age group is attended with increased maternal mortality, spontaneous abortion, fetal anomalies and perinatal mortality. In developing countries, these risks are compounded by high parity and poor medical care. Contraception for women in this age group has special risks and benefits, both should be balanced to choose between the different options available. Recent epidemiological and clinical pharmacology studies have indicated the safety of extending the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) beyond the age of 35 years and up to menopause. The improved picture of COCs has largely resulted from the use of low-dose-formulations, and avoidance of their use in women with risk factors for developing cardiovascular diseases. Besides their high reliability, which is desirable at this age, COCs will prevent the occurrence of climacteric symptoms and menstrual irregularities which are frequently complained of in the premenopausal years. Moreover, the use of COCs has a substantial protective effect against ovarian and endometrial cancers. Women who have reasons for avoiding COCs can use progestogen-only contraceptives like pills, depot injectables and implants. Norplant combines high efficacy and the long-term effect. Both copper-releasing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (LNG-IUD) combine the advantages of high efficacy and long term effect. The reduced fecundity above the age of forty can allow extending the use beyond the accepted term, and up to one or two years beyond the menopause without the need for replacement. The levonorgestrel IUD has the advantage of reducing the amount of menstrual bleeding. The extent of use of barrier methods will depend upon the availability of a back-up by abortion service in case of failure. The condom has the added benefit of protection against STDs. Male or female sterilization is an excellent contraceptive option, provided that this approach is culturally acceptable and available at reasonable cost and low risk.
Increasing the number of contraceptive options available to premenopausal women will improve proper counseling and enhance compliance."
7566002,Natural history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is characterized by intravascular hemolysis and venous thrombosis, is an acquired clonal disorder associated with a somatic mutation in a totipotent hematopoietic stem cell. An understanding of the natural history of PNH is essential to improve therapy.
We have followed a group of 80 consecutive patients with PNH who were referred to Hammersmith Hospital, London, between 1940 and 1970. They were treated with supportive measures, such as oral anticoagulant therapy after established thromboses, and transfusions.
The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 42 years (range, 16 to 75), and the median survival after diagnosis was 10 years, with 22 patients (28 percent) surviving for 25 years. Sixty patients have died; 28 of the 48 patients for whom the cause of death is known died from either venous thrombosis or hemorrhage. Thirty-one patients (39 percent) had one or more episodes of venous thrombosis during their illness. Of the 35 patients who survived for 10 years or more, 12 had a spontaneous clinical recovery. No PNH-affected cells were found among the erythrocytes or neutrophils of the patients in prolonged remission, but a few PNH-affected lymphocytes were detectable in three of the four patients tested. Leukemia did not develop in any of the patients.
PNH is a chronic disorder that curtails life. A spontaneous long-term remission can occur, which must be taken into account when considering potentially dangerous treatments, such as bone marrow transplantation. Platelet transfusions should be given, as appropriate, and long-term anticoagulation therapy should be considered for all patients."
7724151,Membranous dysmenorrhea: the forgotten entity.,"Membranous dysmenorrhea involves the spontaneous slough of the endometrium in one cylindrical or membranous piece that retains the shape of the uterine cavity. Because this entity is rarely mentioned in the medical literature, the purpose of this report is to describe two such cases.
An 18-year-old nullipara with regular menstrual cycles presented with membranous dysmenorrhea after taking the contraceptive Gynera (Gestodene 0.075 mg, ethinyl estradiol 0.030 mg). Symptoms disappeared when the medication was discontinued. The second patient, a 26-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, was on a 10-day monthly regimen of Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 2.5 mg/day for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. When the Provera dose was increased to 10 mg/day, the symptoms disappeared.
Membranous dysmenorrhea is ""a disease of theories"" with various recommended medications. When this condition is caused by iatrogenic treatment, the best approach is to discontinue the offending drug or change its dosage."
7726271,Gynecologic and obstetric aspects of Gaucher's disease: a survey of 53 patients.,"We report our experience on the gynecologic and obstetric features of 53 female patients with Gaucher's disease.
Each patient was interviewed for a detailed medical history, and all underwent a complete physical examination and laboratory work-up.
Delay of puberty onset was encountered in two thirds of the patients without subsequent infertility. Heavy menstrual bleeding was a major problem and was best treated with low-dose oral contraceptives. Of the 102 spontaneous pregnancies' 25 (24.5%) ended in spontaneous first-trimesters abortions; 72 continued beyond the twenty-second week. Nine patients (27.7%) were diagnosed as having Gaucher's disease during their first pregnancies. Aggravation of thrombocytopenia and anemia were prominent features, but antepartum blood transfusion was not required. Early postpartum hemorrhage and fever were increased after both cesarean and vaginal deliveries. Development of bone crisis in seven women during the third trimester and early postpartum periods recurred in subsequent pregnancies. Genotypes had not influenced the gynecologic or obstetric manifestations.
Gynecologic and obstetric complications play a significant role in this patient population, representing an additional burden to female patients with Gaucher's disease."
7709382,"[Oral contraceptives and elective surgery. Strategies in Norwegian hospitals, thromboembolic complications and perioperative conception].","It is widely accepted that treatment with combined oral contraceptives may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism perioperatively. Serious adverse effects such as allergic reactions or bleeding may result from thromboprophylaxis, while stopping the pill may lead to unwanted pregnancy. The objectives of this study were to examine how women on oral contraceptives were treated in Norwegian hospitals in relation to elective surgery, the number of spontaneously reported adverse drug reactions related to thromboprophylaxis, the number of diagnoses of venous thrombo-embolism combined with elective surgery in Norwegian hospitals, and the pregnancy rate in the perioperative pill-free period in this group of women. The study showed that Norwegian hospitals treated women on oral contraceptives in accordance with widely accepted guidelines. No serious adverse drug reactions related to thromboprophylaxis were found, and the frequency of venous thromboembolism in relation to elective surgery seemed to be remarkably small. The pregnancy rate in a perioperative pill-free period appeared to be low, since the women resumed contraception relatively soon after their first postoperative menstrual cycle. It is concluded that the procedures applied in Norwegian hospitals in 1989-90 were safe for this group of patients."
7887531,Rupture and hemorrhage of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia.,"Although adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) are both benign liver lesions, adenomas are associated with a risk of rupture and malignant degeneration. This had led to the general recommendation of resection of adenomas. However, FNH rarely ruptures or becomes malignant, and a nonoperative approach has been adopted by most hepatobiliary centers when the diagnosis of FNH can be made with reasonable certainty. There are only two previous reports of rupture of FNH in the English literature; we present a third case of FNH with spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage. An 18-year-old healthy Caucasian woman presented with sudden onset of severe RUQ pain. She had never been pregnant, nor used oral contraceptive agents, and had not sustained major trauma. Her abdominal exam revealed RUQ tenderness on palpation. Hepatic biochemical tests, CBC, and coagulation tests were normal. Her hematocrit of 44% fell to 31% over 48 hours. CT scan revealed right anterior lobe and left medial segment hypodense liver lesions (4-5 cm) as well as hemoperitoneum and angiography revealed hypervascular lesions. At laparotomy, two tan fibrous subcapsular masses were excised. Pathology showed a central stellate scar in both lesions with several nodules surrounding the central scar on microscopic section, characteristic of FNH. There was evidence of hemorrhage in one lesion. Significant symptoms are an indication for resection of FNH lesions. However, most patients with FNH are asymptomatic and have a normal physical exam. The natural history of these lesions is enigmatic, and the indications for surgery are still evolving. This report emphasizes that a small risk of rupture clearly exists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7621156,Retropharyngeal and bowel hematomas in an anticoagulated patient.,"As the indications for oral anticoagulation therapy increase, the number of patients being treated with anticoagulants and at risk for complications also will rise. Major bleeding episodes have been reported to occur in approximately 2-4% of patients being treated with oral anticoagulants. The case report of a patient with concurrent spontaneous retropharyngeal and small-bowel hematomas from overanticoagulation with warfarin is presented. The authors review the subtle presentation of retropharyngeal hematomas, common medications that may enhance warfarin anticoagulation, and therapy of potentially life-threatening hematomas. Airway management and possible surgical therapies to treat the complications of hematomas are discussed. Depending upon the indication for the initial anticoagulation, interim anticoagulation with heparin may be indicated."
7682320,Persistence of gestational trophoblastic disease for longer than 1 year following evacuation of hydatidiform mole.,"A spontaneous fall in the radioimmunoassay for the beta subunit of hCG to less than 2 mIU/mL documents regression of hydatidiform mole following evacuation of a molar pregnancy. Continued negative hCG levels for the year after evacuation indicates the absence of risk for persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. This report describes an unusual case of recurrent nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease 16 months after initial evacuation.
A 29-year-old woman presented at 19 weeks' gestation with severe preeclampsia and vaginal bleeding. Pelvic ultrasonography demonstrated a molar pregnancy. Pathology following uterine evacuation confirmed a hydatidiform mole. Serial hCG levels fell progressively to less than 2 mIU/mL over the following 25 weeks. She remained compliant with oral contraceptive pills despite having no sexual activity. Sixteen months after uterine evacuation, recurrence of gestational trophoblastic disease was documented by a rising beta-hCG, negative pelvic ultrasound, normal liver function tests, and normal computed tomography of the head. Endometrial curettage showed no chorionic villi or molar tissue. She was treated with five courses of actinomycin D and has remained disease-free for the following 5 years.
This late recurrence of gestational trophoblastic disease suggests that those with a molar pregnancy may benefit from surveillance beyond 1 year after uterine evacuation."
8495933,[Upper airway obstruction--a rare complication after anti-coagulant therapy].,"A case of progressive, spontaneous, nontraumatic hemorrhage into the tonsil, soft palate, hypopharynx, and larynx in a patient receiving oral anticoagulants is presented. There was no evidence of bleeding into other parts of the body. The presenting symptoms of sore-throat, dysphagia and hoarseness were mild at the time of admission. However, the bleeding later caused upper airway obstruction and aspiration, and the clinical picture during hospitalization became dramatic and life-threatening. Physicians should be aware of such possible complications in anticoagulant-treated patients, and if a hematoma is found in the pharynx or larynx the patient should be admitted for close observation and treatment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of spontaneous hemorrhage into the tonsil in a patient on oral anticoagulation."
8478499,Prominent telangiectasia associated with marked bleeding in CREST syndrome.,"A 64-year-old woman with CREST syndrome developed prominent telangiectases mimicking hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) of Osler-Rendu-Weber. We have been following her since she first came to us with discrete telangiectatic mats and Raynaud's phenomenon 11 years ago. Telangiectatic lesions have been seen on her larynx and esophagus in addition to commonly affected sites. She has experienced spontaneous epistaxis and marked bleeding from the lesions on her lips, oral mucous membrane, and soles. This case illuminates new aspects of telangiectasia in CREST syndrome."
8473474,Mifepristone (RU 486) induces embryo expulsion in first trimester non-developing pregnancies: a prospective randomized trial.,"This study was designed to investigate the use of oral mifepristone (RU 486) for the induction of natural expulsion of concepti in women with spontaneously interrupted pregnancy in the first trimester. It consisted of a double-blind placebo-controlled study of mifepristone (600 mg) against placebo. A total of 46 women consulting for interrupted pregnancy were diagnosed at ultrasound with no clinical sign of miscarriage. Measurements were made of the occurrence of natural expulsion, the frequency of complete expulsion, the need for subsequent surgical evacuation, analgesia and the need for transfusion. Natural expulsion occurred within 5 days in 82% of patients receiving mifepristone treatment versus 8% of placebo-treated patients (P < 0.001). All patients experienced bleeding after RU 486 and two needed emergency aspiration for haemorrhagic expulsion. The treatment failed in four patients, who underwent evacuation under local anaesthesia. In the control group, 19 patients underwent evacuation under local (n = 10) or general (n = 9) anaesthesia. It was concluded that a standard oral pilot dose of 600 mg of mifepristone induces natural expulsion in 82% of women with non-developing first trimester intrauterine pregnancies.
At the Hopital A. Beclere in Clamart, France, physicians randomly allocated 46 women with a non-developing, intrauterine pregnancy to either a group receiving a single dose of RU-486 (3 tablets = 600 mg) or a group receiving three tablets of a placebo so they could determine whether RU-486 without an associated prostaglandin could facilitate natural expulsion of the embryo in non-developing first trimester pregnancies with no clinical sign of spontaneous abortion. At the end of five days, natural expulsion was much higher in the RU-486 group than the placebo group (82% vs. 8%; p 0.001). The five-day course for spontaneous expulsion was acceptable for patients and physicians. All RU-486 patients experienced bleeding, compared to only 24% of placebo patients (p 0.01). Two RU-486 patients experienced frank hemorrhage on days two and three of treatment and required emergency aspiration. The 10% hemorrhaging rate equals that of the observed rate of natural expulsion, suggesting that hemorrhaging was likely due to natural expulsion rather than RU-486. RU-486 failed to induce natural expulsion in four women (18%) who then underwent evacuation under local anesthesia. These women had higher initial progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels and shorter amenorrhea (50-70 days) than those who did not experience treatment failure, suggesting a recent ending of trophoblastic activity. Dilation and aspiration were performed on 19 controls under local (10) or general (9) anesthesia. Between day one and day five, the total reduction in progesterone levels and in HCG levels was much greater in the RU-486 group than controls. These findings indicate that a single 600 mg dose of RU-486 is a sound way of managing non-developing pregnancies diagnosed during the first trimester."
1486304,Medical management of missed abortion and anembryonic pregnancy.,"Mifepristone (an antiprogesterone) and misoprostol (a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1) were administered to 60 women diagnosed with missed abortion or anembryonic pregnancy (gestation sac present but no developing embryo) equivalent to 13 weeks' gestation or less who were recruited after counselling. The median age was 227 (range 15-44), and the median duration of amenorrhoea was 71 (42-110) days. 25 of the women had been referred for ultrasound scanning because of bleeding in early pregnancy, while the rest were diagnosed by routine scanning. 29 patients had anembryonic pregnancies, and 31 had a missed abortion. Each patient received a 600 mg single oral dose of mifepristone, and 36-48 hours later misoprostol 600 mcg was given orally (400 mcg and, 2 hours later, 200 mcg). If the products of conception were not expelled within 4 hours, vaginal ultrasonography was performed. 8 patients aborted with mifepristone alone, 43 aborted after taking 600 mcg of misoprostol, and 5 more aborted after receiving a 2nd divided dose of 600 mcg misoprostol. In 3 patients the treatment failed, and they underwent evacuation of the uterus under general anaesthesia. Exploratory curettage was performed in 2 other patients at 14 and 22 days after treatment with misoprostol, but no products of conception were obtained. The median time from administration of misoprostol to abortion was 4 (1-11) hours. The median duration of bleeding after abortion was 10 (2-22) days. Side effects included nausea, vomiting (5 patients received antiemetic drugs), and diarrhoea (7 patients) from misoprostol treatment. 39 women did not want any pain relief, 13 asked for oral analgesia, and 7 obtained parenteral analgesia."
1290774,Pulmonary embolus in an adolescent on oral contraceptives.,"Deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolus is a rare complication of oral contraceptives, which generally occurs in adult women and becomes more common with increasing age. These complications are believed to be less common with low dose oral contraceptives than with the higher dose forms. This is a case report of a deep venous thrombosis presenting with a life-threatening pulmonary embolus in an adolescent on low dose triphasic oral contraceptives.
A 16 year old teenager with chest pain came to the emergency room at Children's Hospital in Charleston, South Carolina. Her sharp, constant midsternal pain and breathing difficulties began the morning of admission. 1 week before admission, she experienced a similar but less intense pain which resolved spontaneously. She was taking low-dose, triphasic oral contraceptives (OCs) as treatment for severe dysmenorrhea and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. She had no family history of elevated lipids, blood or clotting disorders, and cardiovascular disease. She did not smoke. She was obese (137.3 kg). She had elevated blood pressure (147/33 mm Hg), a high low-density lipoprotein count (140 mg/dL), and a high total cholesterol count (237 mg/dL). Her tender right calf was larger than the left calf. She had decreased perfusion of the entire left lung and right lower lobe. A pulmonary angiogram revealed emboli, and ultrasound of the legs revealed a thrombus behind the right knee. The physicians discontinued the OCs. They administered 2 anticoagulants--intravenous heparin followed by oral sodium warfarin for 6 months. Her respiratory distress ended within several days. Her right calf was no longer tender after 1 week. The physicians discharged her on a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet. They suggested she reduce her weight and exercise more often. She did not experience another venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. It appeared that the OCs contributed to her thromboembolism; yet, she did lead a sedentary lifestyle and was considerably overweight. Even though thromboembolism is rare in adolescents with no underlying predisposition for cardiovascular disease and who do not smoke, physicians should watch for sizeable changes in blood pressure, lipids, and cholesterol level as well as symptoms of deep venous thrombosis and cardiovascular disease."
1420822,Dental surgery in patients with severe factor XI deficiency without plasma replacement.,"Bleeding following dental extraction is frequently the first manifestation of severe factor XI deficiency. Safe oral surgery has previously been performed in such patients by using plasma replacement therapy with or without concomitant administration of antifibrinolytic agents. The aim of this study was to determine whether such patients can undergo safe dental extractions using only an antifibrinolytic agent. The study group consisted of 19 patients with severe factor XI deficiency (factor XI:C level less than 14 U/dl) who had previously bled following dental extractions (14 patients) or other trauma (five patients). Tranexamic acid, 1 g q.i.d., was given from 12 h before surgery, until 7 days afterwards. No excessive bleeding was observed following dental extractions. One patient had slight oozing after 3 days which ceased spontaneously. Thus, plasma replacement no longer appears necessary for patients with severe factor XI deficiency requiring dental extractions."
1658955,Hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.,"Hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia are benign lesions of the liver. The incidence of these conditions has been increasing since 1970. Hepatic adenoma primarily affects young women of childbearing age who have a long history of using oral contraceptives, while focal nodular hyperplasia has a wider age distribution and is not associated with the use of oral contraceptives. The most extensive complication of hepatic adenoma is intratumoral or intraperitoneal hemorrhage, which occurs in 50 to 60 per cent of patients. Patients with focal nodular hyperplasia are usually asymptomatic and rarely experience complications. Hepatic adenoma is distinct from focal nodular hyperplasia both in its clinical behavior and its pathologic features; the two can usually be differentiated radiographically using a combination of radionuclide scanning and angiography. There is a proved association between the use of oral contraceptives and the development of hepatic adenoma; the longer the duration of oral contraceptive use, the more the risk of having hepatic adenoma develop. In addition, users of oral contraceptives who have hepatic adenoma develop are likely to have larger tumors and higher rates of bleeding and rupture than nonusers who have hepatic adenoma develop. Although hepatic adenomas may regress after discontinuation of oral contraceptive use, this is not a consistent finding. In addition, it has now been demonstrated that hepatic adenomas do undergo malignant transformation and that this can be detected by measuring the alpha-fetoprotein level. Focal nodular hyperplasia may be a precursor for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Elective resection of hepatic adenoma has a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent, while the mortality rate with free rupture is 5 to 10 per cent. Because of the relative safety of elective versus emergency resection and the potential for malignant change, the treatment of choice for hepatic adenoma is surgical resection.
The benign tumors hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia are compared in their etiology, differential diagnosis, risk of transformation, and management. Hepatic adenomas range in size from 1-30 cm, averaged 8-10 cm in diameter, contain vacuoles and glycogen, but no Kupfer cells or bile ducts. Adenoma is usually symptomatic, causing pressure or hemorrhage. The risk of developing adenoma is increased with duration of oral contraceptive use, and chance of a larger tumor, a hemorrhage and mortality during pregnancy or surgery is also increased in pill users. Adenoma also occurs in people with Type Ia glycogen storage disease, and is associated with insulin-dependent diabetes. Often stopping oral contraceptives will cause an adenoma to regress. If not, It is best managed by elective resection, with 1% mortality, rather than 5-10% mortality due to spontaneous rupture. Adenomas can progress to adenomatosis, which are inoperable, or malignant transformation. Focal nodular hyperplasia is marked by a stellate scar, sometimes accompanied by hemangioma, but is asymptomatic. It is not increased in oral contraceptive users, but occurs in older women. It can transform to fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. The 2 benign lesions can be distinguished by radionuclide scanning and angiography. Only fine needle aspiration is advised for biopsy, because of the risk of hemorrhage with adenoma. Focal nodular hyperplasia takes up radionuclide, stains intensely on angiography, and is safe to biopsy percutaneously."
1906407,Norplant implants: the mechanism of contraceptive action.,"To determine if fertilization occurs unnoticed among Norplant users who are ovulatory.
Serial blood samples were obtained during 1 month from sexually active Norplant users experiencing regular menstrual bleeding patterns and a control group of noncontracepting women trying to conceive. The sequential blood samples were assayed for the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
All samples were obtained from women receiving contraceptive service and health care at the Center for Research and Services in Human Reproduction and Contraception, Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic. Assays for hCG were performed at the Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Tampere, Finland.
A total of 32 women using Norplant implants were enrolled in the treatment group, and 20 women of proven fertility who were attempting to conceive served as a control group.
Duration of Norplant use was as follows: 4 in the 2nd year of use, 13 in the 3rd year, 11 in the 4th year, 3 in the 5th year, and 1 in the 7th year.
The determination of pregnancy was based on the presence of hCG in the luteal phase, using a sensitive and specific immunoenzymatic assay that can detect dimeric hCG as early as 7 days after ovulation.
Nine pregnancies were detected. All were in the control group trying to conceive. Six of these advanced to clinical pregnancies, and three did not proceed beyond the next expected menses. None of the Norplant users had evidence of hCG production, whether the observed cycles were anovulatory or ovulatory. The probability of finding no pregnancies in the ovulatory months at risk among Norplant users is between 1 in 50 and 1 in 150,000. The null hypothesis that Norplant users conceive at a natural rate can be rejected at the 0.05 level.
Interruption of early pregnancy (menstrual abortion) does not play a role in the mechanism of action of Norplant contraceptive implants.
This study sought to determine if fertilization can occur unnoticed among Norplant users who are ovulatory. Serial blood samples were obtained during a 1-month period from women receiving contraceptive service and healthcare at the Center for Research and Services in Human Reproduction and Contraception, Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic. These women were all sexually active Norplant users who experienced regular menstrual bleeding patterns, and their sequential blood samples were assayed for the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Tampere, Finland. There was also a control group of 20 noncontracepting women included who were trying to conceive. Duration of Norplant was as follows: 4 in the 2nd year of use, 13 in the 3rd year, 11 in the 4th, 3 in the 5th year, and 1 in the 7th year. Pregnancy determination was based on the presence of hCG in the luteal phase by use of a sensitive and specific immunoenzymatic assay that can detect dimeric hCG as early as 7 days postovulation. 9 pregnancies were detected, all in the control group who were trying to conceive. 6 of these advanced to clinical pregnancies and 3 terminated spontaneously at the next menstrual period. None of the Norplant users evidenced and hCG production, whether or not the observed cycles were ovulatory. The probability of finding no pregnancies in the ovulatory months at risk among Norplant users is between 1/50 and 1/150,00. The null hypotheses that Norplant users conceive at a natural rate can be rejected at the 0.05 level. Thus, interruption of early pregnancy (menstrual abortion) does not play a role in the mechanism of action of Norplant contraceptive implants."
1916194,Erythematous gingiva with spontaneous bleeding.,
1890760,[Prospective controlled study of elective sclerotherapy plus oral propranolol for prevention of recurrent bleeding in cirrhotics with recent variceal hemorrhage].,"In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, 43 patients with cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage were allocated after control of the bleeding to treat by elective sclerotherapy alone (n = 23) or by oral propranolol after elective sclerotherapy (n = 20). The dose of oral propranolol was based on a reduction of the resting pulse rate by 25%. The end points of the study were rebleeding or death. Both treatment groups were comparable with respect to origin and severity of liver disease, size of esophageal varices and portal pressure at entry. The mean follow up was 27 +/- 19 months for all patients. Patients treated sclerotherapy alone had more rebleeding (n = 11) did than those in the sclerotherapy plus propranolol (n = 3). The cumulative percentages of patients free of rebleeding 1 and 2 years after inclusion were 77 and 66% in sclerotherapy alone, and 100 and 85% in sclerotherapy plus propranolol; the difference between the two groups was significant. No statistically significant effect on mortality was seen. These data support that oral propranolol after sclerotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding in cirrhotics treated elective sclerotherapy."
1918305,Prevalence and genesis of endometriosis.,"A group of 1542 pre-menopausal Caucasian women were assessed prospectively to investigate the prevalence of endometriosis. The women were either having laparoscopy because of infertility (n = 654), undergoing laparoscopic sterilization (n = 598), having laparoscopy because of chronic abdominal and pelvic pain (n = 156) or undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding (n = 134). Endometriosis was noted more frequently among women being investigated for infertility (21%) than among those undergoing sterilization (6%). Among those being investigated for chronic abdominal pain, the incidence of endometriosis was 15%, while among those undergoing abdominal hysterectomy, it was 25%. In all groups the total duration of combined pill usage was significantly higher in patients who had a normal pelvis compared to those with endometriosis. It is suggested that among susceptible women, both fertile and infertile, a prolonged period of regular spontaneous menstruation may play a causative role in the genesis of endometriosis.

1907060,[Liver rupture in peliosis hepatis].,"A 44-year old woman had pain in the epigastric region under the thorax aperture on the left side 6 weeks prior to admission. Her doctor had prescribed Rewodina and Myocuran without success. Then she suffered circulatory collapse twice. Upon hospitalization, she experienced colicky upper abdominal pain and vomiting. She had been taking oral contraceptives (OCs) for 13 years. Spontaneous liver rupture attributable to adenoma was suspected, based on computer tumograms, and laparotomy bore out the suspicion. However, the cause was peliosis hepatis: the left half of the liver was more altered than the right, and a 10cm parenchyma defect was located under the left lateral liver lobe to which a large intrahepatic cavity filled with coagulum was attached. There was a copious amount of blood in the upper abdomen and another hole was filled with old blood. Partial liver resection was performed. The patient returned 3 weeks after recuperation because of fluctuating inflamed swelling developed on the right side. An incision was made to remove the abscess, but instead of finding pus, massive bleeding ensued whose source could not be located; it was squelched by tampons. Removal of the tampons 7 days later started another rupture with signs of liver insufficiency, and the patient died. Although the role of OCs in inducing liver changes has not been conclusively proven, the fact that she had taken OCs for years without any medical supervision seems to implicate this contraceptive method."
1771367,Pathological study on beagles after long-term oral administration of cadmium.,"Histopathological, histochemical, and electron microscopic examinations were performed on beagles after a long-term oral cadmium (Cd) administration of greater than 8 years. Although renal atrophy was remarkable in groups receiving doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight/day, bone lesions could not be demonstrated by roentgenological and histopathologic examination. It was noticed that concomitant regeneration or recovery and cell death of the epithelium occurred in the proximal convoluted tubules. The cell death was consistent with apoptosis, a special feature of cell death, which was shown to play a major part in the tubular damage of cadmium by electron microscopic examination. Fatty degeneration of the pars recta tubules was seen to show dose-dependence. The intrarenal cadmium was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of the proximal tubular epithelium by histochemical and ultracentrifugal cell fractionation examinations. Although no remarkable changes were found in the other organs, aggregates of siderophages in the liver and focal hemorrhage in the spleen, known as spontaneous lesions, might be related to Cd intoxication. In conclusion, the present study revealed that no bone lesions occur with Cd administration in adult beagles in spite of long-term administration. An excessive cell death to regeneration or recovery in the proximal tubules might result in the renal cortical atrophy. No remarkable changes were seen in the glomeruli and distal nephrons, which were in good agreement with Cd distribution."
2103316,"Hereditary protein C deficiency: a review of the genetics, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment.","Protein C (PC) is the central component of a major antithrombotic regulatory system with both anticoagulant and profibrinolytic properties. A deficiency of PC is one of several hereditary abnormalities of haemostatic proteins that have been described in patients with a propensity for thromboembolic complications. Major morbidity is often seen in these patients. The various aspects of hereditary PC deficiency in terms of clinical presentation, genetics, diagnosis and treatment of both homozygous and heterozygous states will be presented. In heterozygous deficiency, the levels of plasma PC are usually between 35% and 65% of normal, whereas the majority of normal individuals have levels between 70% and 130%. PC-deficient patients usually develop venous thrombotic complications between the ages of 15 and 40 years with a high incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism. The majority of thrombotic lesions appear to develop spontaneously; others are associated with trauma, surgery or pregnancy. Treatment of symptomatic patients is initial heparin therapy followed by coumadin. After multiple thrombotic events, lifelong oral anticoagulant therapy is necessary. The potential complications of treatment are coumadin-induced skin necrosis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bleeding. Homozygous PC deficiency, a rare but fatal hereditary condition, manifests itself with massive DIC and purpura fulminans in the newborn period. Effective treatment for these infants can be instituted with either oral anticoagulant therapy or PC replacement. The heterozygous deficiency of PC is similar to that found in other inherited disorders in that several genetic mechanisms are responsible for the expression of the disease. Both quantitative and qualitative decreases in PC exist, the former being type I deficiency and the latter, type II. The best initial diagnosis of either form involves a clotting (functional) assay while differentiation between the two also requires an antigenic (immunological) assay. Autosomal inheritance with significant variable penetrance is found with profound clinical implications. In summary, PC deficiency is one of a group of inherited disorders termed hereditary thrombotic disease, which may have serious implications for patient morbidity and mortality."
2195152,Clinical efficacy of a dentifrice and oral rinse containing sanguinaria extract and zinc chloride during 6 months of use.,"The efficacy of combined use of toothpaste and oral rinse containing sanguinaria extract and zinc chloride was compared to placebo products in a 6-month clinical trial. Sixty subjects with moderate levels of plaque and gingivitis were randomly assigned to active and placebo groups. Noninvasive measures of plaque and gingivitis were assessed at baseline and at 2, 6, 8, 14, 20, and 28 weeks. Bleeding on probing was measured at baseline and 6, 14, and 28 weeks. Active group scores were significantly lower (P less than .0001) than placebo scores at each post-baseline time point for all indices, with the exception of plaque at 2 weeks. The 28 week active group scores were 21% lower than the placebo group for plaque, 25% lower for gingivitis, and 43% lower for bleeding on probing. No dental staining or taste alteration was reported in the active group. Three of 30 active group subjects exhibited minor soft tissue irritations that resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of product use. Results indicate that the test products showed good levels of safety and efficacy when administered in a combined use regimen for 6 months."
2161632,Ruptured hepatic adenoma. A spectrum of presentation and treatment.,"Six cases of ruptured hepatic adenoma treated in our medical center were reviewed with attention directed toward presenting symptomatology and methods of treatment. These patients, five women who were long-term users of oral contraceptives and one man who had never taken steroid medication, presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain of variable degree and duration. The cardiovascular status of these patients was also variable, ranging from a normal blood pressure, which allowed an orderly workup, and planned resection of the tumor to hypovolemic shock requiring emergency laparotomy for control of hemorrhage. The extent of surgery depended on the location and the number of adenomas, with the goal being to resect the adenoma and control hemorrhage while preserving as much normal liver parenchyma as possible. The treatment of choice in this disease is resection of the tumor with a margin of normal liver parenchyma. In those cases in which that is not practical, resectional debridement has proven to be an effective alternative."
2510207,Spontaneous postpartum factor VIII inhibitor development with bleeding into the face and neck.,"The coagulopathy caused by factor VIII inhibitor development can cause life-threatening bleeding that may be difficult to manage. Control of the bleeding, medically and surgically, and normalization of factor VIII and inhibitor levels are the goals of treatment; several modes of therapy are available. A case of spontaneous post-partum development of factor VIII inhibitors was presented and discussed."
2655669,Upper airway obstruction secondary to warfarin-induced sublingual hematoma.,"Sublingual hematoma is a rare but potentially fatal complication of oral warfarin sodium. Less than ten cases are reported in the English-language literature with only two of these appearing in the otolaryngologic literature. Spontaneous bleeding into the sublingual and submaxillary spaces creates a ""pseudo-Ludwig's"" phenomenon with elevation of the tongue and floor of mouth and subsequent airway compromise. Two new cases, along with a review of the literature are presented. Management is directed at prompt control of the airway and reversal of the coagulopathy. Sore throat is a uniform, early complaint that should be taken seriously in any patient receiving oral anticoagulation therapy."
2531968,Clinical evaluation of a new combined oral contraceptive desogestrel--ethinylestradiol.,"A clinical study was performed with a new progestogen, desogestrel, in a 0.15 mg dose associated with 0.03 mg of ethinylestradiol and was administered cyclically during 21 days; 632 cycles were evaluated in 56 women. Side-effects were scarce and generally of a mild nature. Monthly bleeding was normal and present in all cycles. Patients with irregular cycles were normalized to 28/29 days. The intermenstrual bleeding (spotting) was an isolated event in 16 cycles. Mastalgia, the most frequent symptom, disappeared spontaneously in the majority of patients. In only 2 cases was it necessary to stop medication because of side-effects. The contraceptive effect was excellent; no pregnancies occurred. A progestative effect was evident in the cervical mucus and the endometrium. The patients who started treatment with acne improved noticeably. In the mild cases, acne disappeared completely. A discrete improvement in hirsutism was reported. The body-weight variation was not significant. Biochemical studies revealed an increase in HDL-C and a decrease in the ratio LDL-C/HDL-C. Cholesterol and triglycerides did not show variations, which could indicate a lesser cardiovascular risk."
2847128,Liver tumor in long-term user of oral contraceptives.,"Oral contraceptives are implicated in the development of some liver tumors. Paralleling the widespread use of these drugs has been an increase in reported cases of hepatic cell adenomas. Large, multiple tumors, often manifested by spontaneous rupture and hemoperitoneum, have been associated with prolonged use of oral contraceptives. When use of oral contraceptives is discontinued, the hepatic cell adenoma regresses.
A 36 year old obese and hypertensive woman visited her family physician because she felt dizzy and generally weak for 3 days. Even though she had been advised to stop taking the combined oral contraceptive (OC) containing 50 ug ethinyl estradiol and .5 mg norgestrel, at the time she consulted the physician she had been using it for 6 years. Upon admission to a South Carolina hospital, she stopped taking the OC. After appropriate treatment, her condition soon stabilized. The next day, however, she had a fever of 39.44 degrees Celsius, abdominal pain, generalized abdominal tenderness, and rebound tenderness. These symptoms continued through a 2nd day and a laparotomy was warranted. A 15x10 cm hepatic cell adenoma on the right lobe of the liver caused hemorrhaging in the peritoneal cavity. In addition, a 5-6 cm mass was found on the inferior surface of the left lobe. A liver spleen scan 3 weeks following surgery indicated diminished activity at the tumor site on the right lobe. 1 1/2 years later, physicians excised the now reduced tumor (4x2 1/2 cm) on the left lobe and the right lobe adenoma had necrotized and regressed. 15 months following excision of the left lobe tumor, a needle liver biopsy showed a mild, fatty change in the liver. No further liver problems have developed. Research demonstrates that prolonged use of OCs predisposes women to the development of hepatic cell adenoma, and large multiple tumors are associated with especially lengthy use. Research also indicates that when OC use stops, these tumors regress, but can reoccur if OC use or any estrogen therapy is reinstituted or if pregnancy occurs."
3405025,[Laser surgery in ENT surgery].,"From a number of medically useful lasers, mainly the neodymium YAG and the carbon dioxide laser are employed in otorhinolaryngology. Until now, the neodymium YAG laser has been used only for coagulation of vessels in Osler's disease and for palliative treatment of malignant tracheo-oesophageal disease. However, the deep coagulation necrosis of the adjacent tissues severely restricts its use. The most widely utilised laser in ENT surgery is the carbon dioxide laser. Its main effect of precise cutting with an extremely fine zone of coagulation reduces bleeding after incision considerably. Secondary tissue reactions, delayed healing, decreased fibroblast activity and maybe more prominent subepithelial scarring, limit its use especially in the glottic region. Therefore, minor vocal cord alterations such as vocal nodules, cysts or polyps suitable for excision with scissors, should not be removed by laser. Optional indications are Reinke's oedema, intubation granulomas and contact pachydermas. Clear advantages of laser use are seen in the treatment of juvenile papillomas of the vocal fold and of smaller vocal cord carcinomas or recurrences after irradiation therapy of these. The carbon dioxide laser is superior to all other indications in the removal of large and obstructing laryngeal carcinomas to prevent tracheostomy. Very reliable is its use in the ablation of lingual tonsillar tissue to improve or eliminate symptoms in recurrent lingual tonsillitis. Transoral resection of small malignant lesions in the oral and pharyngeal cavity may be performed in analogy to electric cautery. The advantages of the laser compared to electrical surgery are a smaller postoperative oedema and less pain, as well as good spontaneous epithelialisation of defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3375998,Intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis of the visceral arteries in a young woman: possible relation with oral contraceptives and smoking.,"This is a report of a 26-year-old woman who died of a massive intestinal infarction caused by occlusion of the celiac axis and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Autopsy showed intimal hyperplasia and an overlying thrombus that obstructed the lumen of the vessel. As shown by Irey et al., exogenous or endogenous female reproductive steroids can act on the vascular system as a target organ and induce intimal hyperplasia and thrombus formation. The effects of contraceptive estrogens and progestogens are discussed, but the catalytic effect of heavy cigarette smoking appears to be the factor that induces, in predisposed women with hyperplasia, thrombosis of visceral arteries. In this case report we want to emphasize that the association between smoking and oral contraceptives can cause cardiovascular disease in young women. Failure to recognize this fact could result in delayed diagnosis and worsen the prognosis.
To further understand the pathophysiology of arterial diseases induced by oral contraceptives (OCs), a case report is presented of a young woman who died of extensive visceral artery thrombosis. The possible role of estrogens and progestogens and of cigarette smoking as the predisposing factors in this patient are discussed. A 26-year-old woman, who complained of progressive abdominal pain and whose past medical and surgical history was negative, was admitted to the general surgery service. She was the mother of 1 child and had had 2 previous spontaneous abortions. She had received ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg with norethindrone 500 mcg and 1000 mcg for 3 months, but because of a problem with breakthrough bleeding the medication was changed to mestranol 50 mcg with norethindrone 1000 mcg. She had been taking Ortho-Novum 1/50 for 2 1/2 years. She had smoked 25-35 cigarettes daily for about 10 years but denied use of alcohol or other drugs. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, or dyslipidemic, and had no history of atherosclerosis in her family. For 7 months prior to her admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain, which progressively increased in intensity and duration, interrupted by periods of well-being. The patient reported 2 recent, isolated episodes of mild proctalgia but no tenesmus or melena. There had been no fever, but the patient had been anorexic for the past 2 weeks and reported losing 10 kg in the past month. She had no complaints apart from those related to the gastrointestinal system. At an emergency laparotomy, gangrenous acalculous cholecystitis and infarction of the terminal ileum were discovered. A cholecystectomy with resection of the terminal ileum and the right colon was performed. An end-to-end primary anastomosis was performed. On exploration of the superior mesenteric artery, a thrombus was discovered at its origin. As a transverse arteriotomy showed a good retrograde flow, a thrombectomy was performed. There appeared to be an unsatisfactory antegrade flow. The superior mesenteric artery then was transposed in an end-to-end fashion on the abdominal aorta. An immediate postoperative arteriogram showed thrombosis of the celiac axis at its origin. Revascularization failed to improve the condition of the intestine. The patient died. The intent of this case report is to emphasize that the association between smoking and oral contraceptives can cause cardiovascular disease in young women, and a failure to recognize this association can result in delayed diagnosis and worsen the prognosis."
3259958,Acute promyelocytic leukemia appearing as spontaneous oral hemorrhage: report of case.,"Oral signs and symptoms may often signify a serious underlying systemic disease. This case report describes a 45-year-old Oriental male with spontaneous oral hemorrhage and submucosal bullae of 4 days' duration. These oral findings represent the initial manifestations of acute promyelocytic leukemia. An aggressive postdiagnostic course was taken; however, the patient died 8 days after the diagnosis was established."
12281497,Choice at any cost.,"Women have devised ways of ending unintended pregnancies since the dawn of civilization and will continue to do so. Human behavior, misplaced political priorities, and inadequate technologies all are responsible for the fact of abortion. An estimated 50 million abortions were performed worldwide in 1987, slightly less than 2/3 of which were legal. Spontaneous abortion ends far more conceptions than does induced abortion. Based on rates of use around the globe, abortion ranks 4th among family planning methods, after female sterilization, IUDs, and oral contraceptives (OCs). Unplanned pregnancies are essentially the result of lack of access to and inconsistent use of contraceptives. Mere access to abortion does not assure an end to unplanned pregnancy. Inconsistent birth control use and reliance on contraceptive methods with high failure rates contribute to unintended pregnancies and abortions around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year 1 million or more women die from pregnancy-related causes. Fully 99% of these deaths occur in the 3rd world, where complications arising from pregnancy and illegal abortions are the leading cause of death in women in their 20s and 30s. Most of the 20 million or so illegal abortions that occur every year are performed by unskilled attendants under unsanitary conditions, leaving women vulnerable to serious infection, internal bleeding, hemorrhaging, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Modern abortion procedures performed under proper medical supervision in countries where they are legal are responsible for fewer maternal deaths than pregnancy itself. Regardless of the country or the law, gaining access to abortion actually is a matter of economics and social attitudes. The past 2 decades have seen a general continuation of the post-World War II trend of liberalizing abortion laws, with more than 30 countries increasing access at least statutorily, but some countries actually have made their regulations more restrictive. So-called abortion migration, from countries with restrictive laws to those with more lenient policies, works to divide women with unintended pregnancies into those who can afford to travel to obtain an abortion and those who cannot and consequently resort to illegal procedures or carry the pregnancy to term. History documents that women determined to exercise control over their reproductive choices will do so, even if this means opting for dangerous illegal abortions. Laws cannot suppress abortion practices. All they can do is make abortion more or less safe and costly."
3259521,[Endoscopic sclerotherapy versus propranolol after hemorrhage caused by rupture of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. Results of a 4-year randomized study].,"Between December 1982 and April 1987, we conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficiency of endoscopic sclerotherapy with oral propranolol after variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis. We present our results after a median follow-up of 3 years (range = 57-231 weeks). The sclerotherapy group (S) consisted of 28 patients and the propranolol group (P), 27 patients. The two groups were similar for age, sex, etiology and severity of liver disease, and severity of hemorrhage; the only difference concerned previous hemorrhages which were significantly more numerous in the S group. Sclerotherapy was performed with polidocanol 1 p. 100. A slow-release preparation of propranolol was used; the average daily dose was 160 mg. Eighteen patients in the S group had at least one hemorrhagic recurrence as opposed to 12 in the P group. This difference was not significant nor was the difference between actuarial curves of no-rebleeding (p = 0.30). No difference was noted concerning total deaths (15 in S versus 12 in P). Cumulative survival curves showed a non-significative difference (p = 0.99) percentages of survival in S and P groups were 75.0 p. 100 and 73.6 p. 100 at 1 year, 67.9 p. 100 and 64.6 p. 100 at 2 years, and 51.1 p. 100 and 52.7 p. 100 at 3 years respectively. Stratification according to Child's group, variceal size and history of variceal hemorrhage did not modify these results. However, male patients had less hemorrhagic recurrences with propranolol than after sclerotherapy. Length of hospitalization was not different in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
12282575,[Gynecological risks of contraception in adolescents].,"The gynecological risks of contraception for young girls depend on the method used. Risks are almost nonexistent for oral contraceptives (OCs) and are significant only for IUDs. OCs are the only completely effective method. Users should be informed about the possibility of slight bleeding irregularities, which are usually transitory. A more serious problem, postpill amenorrhea, is apparently not a function of the age of the user but of the dose and the possible existence of cycle problems such as episodes of spontaneous amenorrhea before OC use. Low- dose combined pills disturb hypothalamopituitary function less profoundly than do higher dosed formulations and are preferable for that reason. Periodic interruption of OC use to verify cycle return has been a longstanding practice but has not been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the incidence of postpill amenorrhea. It does increase the possibility of undesired pregnancy and should be avoided in adolescents. Early fears that use of sexual steroids would limit the bone growth of young girls have not been confirmed. The major growth spurts precede puberty. A recent fear is more serious: that the later risk of breast cancer is increased by use of an OC before the 1st normal pregnancy. The methodology of the retrospective study that suggested increased risk has been criticized. It is possible that early pregnancy protects against breast cancer rather than OC use before pregnancy increasing risk. Fears that the pregnancy risk of forgetting 1 or more low-dosed pills are too great do not seem realistic enough to justify avoiding their use in adolescents. It should be sufficient to recommend that the 1st pill be taken on the 1st cycle day and that supplemental precautions be taken in case pills are forgotten on 2 consecutive days. Fears that low-dose combined OCs do not inhibit ovarian folliculogenesis sufficiently do not seem to warrant avoiding low-dosed formulations. Triphasics are associated with slightly higher serum estradiol levels at the beginning of treatment, but levels are comparable to those of other formulations by the 3rd week of use. Low-dose synthetic progestin-only formulations do not seem appropriate for adolescents because of their higher failure rate, bleeding problems, and other side effects. IUDs should be avoided because of the significant risk of infection. They should be considered a last resort if no other method is possible. Diaphragms and condoms can be used on an as needed basis and offer protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Their higher failure rate and interruption of coitus are major disadvantages."
3215264,Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage from kidney causes.,"Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage is an uncommon entity and even rarer when the underlying cause is from the kidney. Renal tumors comprise the majority of atraumatic kidney rupture. Renal cell carcinoma and angiomyolipoma are the most common diseases in this group. Oral anticoagulant therapy and hemodialysis could be responsible for a few cases. In 3 reported cases no pathological explanation could be found. With the help of modern facilities, diagnosis can be made preoperatively and conservative surgery is indicated in these patients. However, nephrectomy is the treatment of choice for patients presenting with shock as the initial symptom or solid renal mass with perirenal hematoma."
3828141,[Intracranial hemorrhage in infancy due to vitamin K deficiency: report of a case with multiple intracerebral hematomas with ring-like high density figures].,"It is well known that vitamin K deficiency is an important cause of the spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in infancy. A 60-day-old male infant with spontaneous intracerebral hematomas due to vitamin K deficiency was presented. He was breast-fed. He had been medicated oral antibiotic agent for diarrhea and fever. Three days later he developed petechien, vomiting and twitching, and became drowsy. The blood studies showed anemia, and advance of ESR. He was administered of vitamin K immediately. CT scan was showed four intracerebral hematomas with niveau, which were surrounded by high-density rings. The ring-like figures were unique for this case. The reason may be next, we think. Under the states in which blood can separate easily with advance of ESR, blood clot would adhere to the wall of the hematomas. So these hematomas showed ring-like figures and had niveau in them. CT scan of this case was also interesting because there was little deviation in spite of the big hematomas. The reason of this may be that the brain of infancy is incomplete in myelination and contains much water, and that the possibility of bleeding due to vitamin K occurs slowly. We examined 84 cases of intracranial hemorrhage due to vitamin K deficiency from literatures, and they were all identified for the hemorrhage sites by CT scan. Subarachnoidal hemorrhage was in 72 cases (85.7%), subdural hemorrhage was in 41 cases (48.8%), intracerebral hematomas was in 36 cases (42.9%) and intraventricular hemorrhage was in 9 cases (10.7%). In 52 cases the CT findings were described.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4044506,Treatment of epilepsy in women of childbearing age.,"This article updates the literature on the treatment of epilepsy in women of reproductive age. Specific areas discussed include the effect of menstruation on seizure frequency, use of oral contraceptives (OCs), the effect of pregnancy on epilepsy, the effect of seizures on pregnancy and the fetus, the impact of antiepileptic drugs on the fetus, medical termination of pregnancy, breast feeding, and the risk of epilepsy in offspring. Exacerbtion of seizure activity is often seen in premenstrual and menstrual phases, and cyclic use of acetazolamide and/or progesterone (which exerts a protective effect against seizures) is recommended. OCs appear to have only a minor impact on epilepsy and the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs. On the other hand, these drugs can influence the metabolism and effectiveness of OCs. Concomitant use of OCs and antiepileptics can result in a higher incidence of acne and hirsutism, increased intermenstrual bleeding, and failure of contraception. The incidence of contraceptive failure is higher with low-dose estrogen OCs. In general, pregnancy appears to have an unfavorable effect on cerebral dysrrhythmia in epileptics. Possible causes for the increase in seizure frequency during pregnancy include psychological, hormonal, metabolic, and pharmacokinetic factors. The effect of epilepsy and antiepileptics on offspring is unclear. There appears to be an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirths in women taking antiepileptic drugs. In addition, a 3-fold increase in the incidence of congenital malformations has been noted in these women. The risks of birth defects are greater when there is a family history of birth defects, when the father is also epileptic, when a previous pregnancy resulted in a malformed child, when seizures during pregnancy are poorly controlled, and when multipel antiepileptic drugs are used in high doses. Although offspring may inherit the epileptic trait, they do not always manifest the disease."
12280202,[Teratogenic and mutagenic risks of radiotherapy: when and how to prescribe contraception].,"The increasing potential for curing cancer in young patients poses problems of contraceptive choice and pregnancy planning for these patients. Chemotherapy instead of surgical removal of some tumors may allow preservation of reproductive function. The ovary is highly sensitive to radiation; the degree of sensitivity depends on the dose received and the age of the patient. If ovarian function is maintained or regained, the subsequent teratogenic risk appears to be minimal although the incidence of spontaneous abortion is increased. The testicle is even more radiosensitive than the ovary, but the later mutagenic or chemotherapeutic risk appears small. The majority of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents have a mutagenic potential as demonstrated by the Ames test. The impact of chemotherapy on the ovary is gauged by effects on the menstrual cycle, the possibility of later pregnancy, and hormonal levels. Clinical manifestations of ovarian effects include amenorrhea, signs of estrogen insufficiency, and elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels. The most gonadotoxic are the alkylating agents, methyl donors, and intercalating agents, with antimetabolites apparently less toxic. Continuous or high dose administration results in higher toxicity, as does administration of a combination of drugs. The effects of chemotherapy depend on age and indirectly on the type of cancer. It is not yet possible to quantify the risk of precocious menopause after chemotherapy. The risk from fetal exposure to ionizing radiation is greatest during the 1st 16 weeks of embryonic life. After the organs are formed, risks of retarded growth or of cancer in the infant continue to be significant. Numerous cytotoxic agents are known to have abortifacient or teratogenic effects in animals, but extrapolation of experimental results to humans is difficult. Exposure during the 1st trimester involves a significant risk of fetal anomaly although normal births have occurred after monochemotherapy. The teratogenic risk appears to be small following mono- or polychemotherapy in the 2nd or 3rd trimester, but longterm carcinogenic risks are unknown. The risk of fetal anomalies in pregnancies begun after maternal anticancer treatment appears to increase with maternal age at treatment, total dose of anticancer agents, use of a combination of drugs, the duration of treatment, simultaneous radiation treatment, and the shortness of the time elapsed since treatment. Effective contraception should be practiced during cancer treatment, and pregnancy, if not contraindicated, should not be attempted until 2 years after treatment. No prospective studies have been done on contraceptive indications for cancer patients. Oral contraceptives containing estrogen are logically contraindicated for women with estrogen dependent tumors, which for premenopausal women would be limited to breast cancer. Contraindications for IUDs are more broad and depend on the type of anticancer therapy, with intensive polychemotherapy entailing risks of hemorrhage and infection a strong contraindication."
3834715,[Peliosis hepatis with liver rupture].,"The case of a 50-year-old woman with a ruptured liver caused by peliosis hepatis is presented. Death occurred three days after laparotomy for an acute abdomen with a clinical diagnosis of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Autopsy findings including histology are presented and the possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed. There was neither evidence of a tumor nor of drug or toxin exposure. Known etiologic factors for this disorder are discussed on the basis of the medical literature. These include consumptive primary disorders, anabolic agents and oral contraceptives. The pathogenetic sequence involves damage to the endothelial cells of the hepatic sinuses and to the reticular fiber network. This case should make physicians aware of this infrequent iatrogenic disorder which is apparently increasing in its occurrence."
6508652,Oral contraceptives.,"4 kinds of progestin only oral contraceptives (OCs) and numerous combined OCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) or occasionally mestranol and either norgestrel or norethindrone are currently available in Australia. All progestins except norgestrel are effective in vivo after metabolism to norethindrone. Mestranol is effective in the human after demethylation to EE. The main side effects of OCs, including menstrual disturbances and changes in weight and mood, are primarily of nuisance value. Menstrual blood loss with OCs is almost invariably less than during spontaneous menses, but breakthrough bleeding and midcycle spotting may cause concern in patients. Amenorrhea and weight gain are rare with low dose pills. Approximately 6 in 1000 women remain anovulatory for 12 months or more after discontinuing OCs, but it is not yet know whether the amenorrhea is related to pill use and it is usually corrected by induction of ovulation. Cardiovascular side effects including venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are seen less frequently with new lower dose pills. The effects of OCs on the cardiovascular system are complex and depend on the interaction of estrogen and progestin. Amounts of estrogen and progestin should be the lowest possible to prevent ovulation, and routine monitoring should be provided for all women using pills. Older high dose formulations altered lipid metabolism in the direction of greater risk of coronary heart disease. Although research suggests the lowest dose triphasic pills have no significant effect, not enough large studies have been done with matched controls. Any effects on carbohydrate metabolism of the low dose pills are apparently minor and of little clinical significance. Insulin dependent diabetics with adequate supervision may safely use low dose pills. Combined OCs reduce the incidence of endometrial and ovarian malignancy. No relationship between OCs and the risk of breast cancer has been demonstrated except possibly in women under 35 when the cancer developed. The risk of intraepithelial neoplasia may be increased in women taking OCs for more than 8 years. Data on drug interactions are inconclusive, but women on rifampicin should use some other method. Absolute contraindications to OCs include breast cancer, history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, active liver disease, use of rifampicin, familial hyperlipidemia, previous arterial thrombosis, and pregnancy, while relative contraindications include smoking, age over 35, hypertension, breastfeeding, and irregular spontaneous menstruation. Progestin only OCs have a higher rate of failure and irregular bleeding than combined pills and their main use is for breastfeeding women and those with contraindications to estrogen. The pill of 1st choice should be a triphasic low-dose formulation."
6712464,Sexual function during the puerperium.,"Of 328 women interviewed at a postnatal clinic, 166 (50.6%) had resumed sexual intercourse, the average interval after delivery being 5 weeks postpartum. Of the various social and clinical factors examined, resumption of coitus was related only to marital status, vaginal laceration, and continuing vaginal bleeding. Of the sexually active group, 89% were practicing effective contraception.
328 English-speaking women in their 5th to 7th postpartum week attending postnatal clinics at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and the Mother's Hospital in Hackney, England, were interviewed to determine the time of resumption of intercourse during the puerperium and its relationship to a variety of sociodemographic factors, events during and after childbirth, and contraceptive practice in the puerperium. 166 of the 328 women had resumed intercourse. The mode was the 5th postpartum week. No social factor execpt marital status was related to resumption of sexual activity. The incidence of puerperal coitus was not related to onset or duration of labor, epidural analgesia, mode of delivery, birthweight, or events at delivery. Episiotomy in a spontaneous delivery was not associated with delay, but coitus was delayed in cases of vaginal laceration, with the significance related to the extent of laceration. There was a significant association between cessation of lochial loss and resumption of coitus, but no association with occurrence of menstruation or breastfeeding. 100 women experienced no undue distress during the 1st coitus, and the remaining 66 complained of varying degrees of discomfort, with 44 refraining from further intercourse. 149 women in the sexually active group used contraception during the 1st coitus, with oral contraception and the condom the most frequent. Only 55 subjects recalled the advice of the medical and nursing staff regarding resumption of intercourse."
6428806,Pituitary and ovarian function and clinical performance during the use of a levonorgestrel-releasing intracervical contraceptive device.,"A levonorgestrel-releasing intracervical device (ICD) was inserted postmenstrually to twenty-one voluntary women. Eight subjects gave blood samples twice a week during the initial three months of use of the ICD and during the seventh and twelfth months of use. Clinical performance was studied; plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel were measured by radioimmunoassay and the effects of the treatment on pituitary and ovarian function were determined by assaying plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone. The results of the first year are presented. Dysmenorrhea, menstrual flow and the number of days of bleeding decreased during the first treatment year. Three spontaneous expulsions occurred; two at the very beginning of the treatment and one after six months of use. Side-effects were few. The plasma level of levonorgestrel remained fairly constant during the observation time of 12 months. Thirty-one of the 36 cycles were ovulatory as judged by plasma progesterone elevations. No pregnancies occurred during the study period of one year."
6318404,Enovid-induced exacerbation of the propensity for stroke in low protein fish diet-fed stroke-prone/SHR.,"Weanling, male and female, stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SP/SHR) were fed either a regular diet, a low protein diet derived from fish tissue + 1% saline drinking water, or the fish diet + 1% saline + daily injections of 0.1 mg Enovid/100 g bw/sc. After 48 days, the Enovid-treated animals developed acute and lethal strokes characterized by massive thrombonecrogenic lesions of the parietal lobe. The blood pressure of the Enovid-treated SP/SHR rose most acutely. The low protein fish diet was markedly catabolic and caused hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, elevated ACTH and beta-endorphin levels concomitant with reduced gonadotrophic function. Treatment with Enovid caused severe exacerbation of all of the foregoing changes. It is proposed that a low protein fish diet + 1% saline will accelerate the appearance of strokes in SP/SHR and that Enovid will enhance this effect through its anti-gonadotrophic activity and ability to stimulate increased pituitary-adrenal secretion."
6406157,Clinical experience with a triphasic oral contraceptive ('Trinordiol') in young women.,"Seven hundred and fifty cycles of treatment with a new triphasic oral contraceptive (WL-49(50). 'Trinordiol') containing the lowest quantity of steroids of all available preparations were evaluated in 75 healthy young women (mean age 19.6 years), 70% of whom had regular, normal cycles. Sixty-five percent had not used contraception before; the others had previously been on combined or progestagen-only oral contraceptives or had an IUD. The mean length of treatment with the triphasic preparation was 10 cycles. No pregnancy was recorded during the 750 cycles of treatment. Fifteen (20%) women dropped out of the study for medical reasons, essentially breast tenderness, weight increase, spotting and nausea, in decreasing order of frequency. Mastalgia was present in 21% of the women (8.9% of the cycles) during triphasic oral contraception, but this symptom disappeared in more than half of the cases within 3 months of continued use. Other side-effects were less frequent: vaginal discharge (4.4% of the cycles), nausea (3.7%), abdominal and leg cramps (2.8%), headaches (3.2%) and weight increase (3%). Spotting and breakthrough bleeding were reported during only 1.9% of the cycles, a remarkably low frequency. No absence of withdrawal bleeding was noted. Weight and blood pressure changes were minimal and never reached statistical significance. Hypertension developed during triphasic medication in 1 predisposed individual. Complaints of oestrogen-related symptoms such as breast tenderness and digestive disorders were probably due to the reduced progestagen content of the preparation compared with combined low fixed daily dose oral contraceptives. However, no increases in dysmenorrhoea and/or premenstrual tension were noted. It is concluded that the triphasic preparation provides effective contraception with excellent cycle control and minimal side-effects, which should help to increase the acceptability of low-dose combined oral contraceptives.
750 cycles of treatment with a new triphasic oral contraceptive (OC), (WL-49(50), Trinordiol), containing the lowest quantity of steroids of all available preparations were evaluated in 75 healthy young women (mean age 19.6 years). 70% of all young women had normal, regular menstrual cycles. 65% had not used contraception previously, and the others had previously taken combined or progestogen only OCs or had an IUD. The mean length of treatment with the triphasic preparation was 10 cycles. Routine clinical evaluation, including gynecological examination, weight and blood pressure measurement, assessment of cycle events, and recording of spontaneously reported side effects, was performed every 3 months. Cycle control during triphasic OC use was very good. There was a statistically significant trend of the cycles toward more regularity than prior to this type of contraception, with an increased frequency of 28-day cycles. Duration of menses was significantly reduced and menstrual volume was more frequently rated by the women as normal. Spotting and breakthrough bleeding showed a very low frequency, the latter accounting for less than 10% of intermenstrual bleeding during triphasic OC medication. Frequency of side effects was 53.3% (40 women) during triphasic OC use. 20% of the population reported side effects among the reasons for stopping triphasic OC use. Breast tenderness was the most frequent side effect recorded in almost 9% of the total number of treatment cycles. It affected 21% of the women under study, a significantly more frequent occurrence than before triphasic OC use in these individuals. The tendency of this symptom to improve was observed in more than half of the cases within 3 months use of triphasic OC use. Other signs of estrogenic dominance such as gastrointestinal disturbances, vaginal discharge, pelvic congestion, and leg cramps were also present but much less prominent than breast tenderness. 16 (21.3%) patients presented with breast tenderness for 67 (8.9%) cycles. Nausea and vomiting were experienced by 6 (8%) patients for 28 (3.7%) cycles. Vaginal discharge was present in 10 (13.3%) patients for 33 (4.4% cycles). Spotting and breakthrough bleeding occurred in 6 (8%) women for 14 (1.9% cycles). Absence of change in weight was recorded in 1/3 of the women studied; another 1/3 experienced a weight reduction of 1-4 kg and the last 1/3 gained 1-4 kg. There were no statistically significant variations in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure values."
6754625,"[Contraception: yes, but at what cost?].","This article, arguing that consumers have a right to be informed about the dangers of health care measures, discusses the health risks of oral contraceptives (OCs) and IUDs. In a brief review of the history of contraceptive development and use, it is stated that the 1st OC was tested on only 132 women in Puerto Rico before being approved for commercial use. OCs, which inhibit ovulation, sperm penetration, and implantation of the egg, represent the surest and most convenient contraceptive yet developed. Despite their advantages, pills may cause various secondary effects such as spotting, water retention, irritability, nervousness, nausea, vaginitis, migraine headaches, hypertension, and others, whose alleviation is responsible for large additional profits to the pharmaceutical industry. Although results are difficult to interpret and the passage of time may not have been sufficient, disquieting indications of a possible carcinogenic effect of OCs have been noted. The pill has been implicated in an elevated incidence of thromboembolism and is known to influence the metabolism of some substances, and the list of contraindications for pill use is long. Women wishing to use pills should consult a conscientious physician who will take a complete medical history, perform a thorough physical, and furnish complete information on the risks of pill use. IUD mode of action is incompletely understood. Fewer than 2/3 of women accepting IUDS are able to tolerate them for more than 1 year, from 7 to 20% of IUDs are spontaneously expelled, and from 3-35% are removed at the request of the client for pelvic pain and bleeding. Another 4-15% are removed each year for other medical reasons. IUD related mortality is less than that related to OCs, but a series of secondary effects and contraindications are associated with their use. If a woman chooses to use an IUD despite everything, she should choose a physician experienced in IUD insertion who is not experimenting with a new type of device. The preference for powerful contraceptives has caused women to excuse men from sharing in the responsibility for birth control, among other deleterious effects."
6807926,Burkitt's lymphoma cell leukemia. Radiology and cytotoxic medication.,"A 15-year-old girl presented with swelling and spontaneous bleeding of the gingiva. The lower anterior teeth were sensitive to percussion, and the lower lip and chin showed lack of sensation. Radiographically, gross loss of the alveolar and basal bone in both jaws was evident. The lamina dura and periodontal ligament had lost their morphology. Based on the clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma cell leukemia was made. While cytotoxic medication brought about an immediate clinical improvement, radiographically, jaw bone repair became evident one month following initiation of treatment."
7195872,Precursor stage of hepatocellular neoplasm following long exposure to orally administered contraceptives.,"Hepatic neoplasms and peliosis are known to occur in women taking contraceptives orally. We observed hyperplasia of hepatocytes combined with hypertrophy of sinusoidal lining cells and sinusoidal dilatation with progression to peliosis in the liver of a patient who had been taking such contraceptives for 10 years. These changes resembled the precursor stage in the development of hepatic angiosarcoma induced by vinyl chloride, Thorotrast, and arsenic. In users of orally administered contraceptives these findings may precede the development of hepatocellular neoplasms.
A case report of a 32-year-old patient who had been taking OCs (oral contraceptives) for 10 years is summarized. Microscopic photographs taken at the biopsy are presented and discussed. Hyperplasia of hepatocytes combined with hypertrophy of sinusoidal lining cells and sinusoidal dilatation with progression to peliosis in the liver were found at biopsy. These changes resemble the precursor stage of hepatocellular neoplasm. Although most of the tumors associated with OCs are benign, they may represent a serious threat to the patient, since they can rupture spontaneously, resulting in intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Women using OCs should be carefully monitored in order to detect the changes described in this report or actual hepatic tumors. Discontinuation of the OCs may reverse the development of the hepatic changes."
7243080,[Experience with and remarks 1 year's application of the abortion law 194].,"Between June 1978 and June 1979 514 voluntary interruptions of pregnancy were done at the Valdarno Aretino Hospital Board, Montevarchi, Italy. The operations were performed by the Karman method on women in their first trimester of pregnancy, and on an outpatient basis. 97% of patients were in the age group 18-30; 46% were unmarried, and 49% married. 95% had at least a high school diploma, and most were working outside the house; nulliparous patients were 48%, and multiparous 52%. There were 2 cases of uterine perforation, and no infections or hemorrhage. Most women had been referred to the hospital not by a family planning center but by their private physician. It was unfortunately noted that only few patients had sometimes been on OC (oral contraception); most patients had never used effective contraception. During the same period of time and in the same hospital, the number of the so called spontaneous abortions decreased 7%, and the number of deliveries decreased 13%."
6903023,[From Gräfenberg to the Multiload Cu 250--the development of the so-called spiral].,"A general description of the development and qualities of the IUD is given. The first true IUD was developed by von Graefenberg in 1925, after which physicians in many lands did research to improve the effectiveness and acceptability of these devices. The most common IUDs are made of plastic and covered with a thin layer of copper, which increases the effectiveness of the IUD so that it can be kept smaller, thus causing less uterine irritation. The IUD has been a more important contraceptive for the Third World than in the industrialized nations, where oral contraceptives are preferred. The effectiveness of the IUD in humans is due to an inhibition of implantation: this is caused in part by an increase in macrophagocytes and a disturbance of the synchronization between the movement of the fertilized ovum and the phases of the endometrium. Extreme care must be taken to avoid spreading infection when inserting an IUD. In the case of pregnancy or infection, the IUD should be removed immediately. Pain and bleeding are other side effects of IUD use. IUDs can also cause uterine perforation. If pregnancy occurs with an IUD in situ, the IUD should be removed immediately; if evidence of infection is present, an abortion may be indicated. Most pregnancies with IUD in situ result in spontaneous abortion. In cases where a pregnancy with IUD in situ has been carried to term, no increased instance of birth defects has been established, although the number is not large enough to give unequivocal statistical evidence."
700553,[Contraception with the intrauterine pessary Progestasert].,"A prospective study was carried out from June 1973 to August 1976 in 131 women fitted with a newly developed IUD (Progestasert). The IUD's were removed as planned after 12 months with the exception of 4 cases in which they were retained for up to 17 months. The evaluation of the trial was performed according to the Life Table Analysis and the usual statistical methods. 1496 application months were evaluated. One case each of intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies were observed. One patient experienced spontaneous expulsion of the IUD. In 9 cases medical reasons led to the removal of Progestasert at an earlier date. Duration, intensity, and interval of menstruation as well as frequency of spotting and dysmenorrhea were recorded. A slight increase in duration and interval of menstruation was seen whereas bleeding intensity was reduced. Increased spotting, especially during the first month after insertion, and a significant reduction of dysmenorrheal complaints were noted after 2 months. In addition to 8 removals due to bleeding disturbances, 6 other patients experienced spotting throughout the entire treatment period. Laboratory tests such as ESR, WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit and cytological smear determinations were carried out. No pathological alterations of these parameters were found.
117 women underwent 131 insertions of the Progestasert IUD. 22 patients were nulliparae; 80 of the patients had previously used oral contraceptives. Significant increases were observed in the length of menstruation (p.01) and the length of the menstrual interval (p.05), while a significant decrease in the menstrual intensity was observed (p.01). There was a significant decrease in the incidence of dysmenorrhea (p.01). The rate of spotting returned to normal after a marked increase during the first 3 months of Progestasert use. Previous oral contraceptive use could not be correlated to the incidence of the changes in the menstrual cycle. The continuation rate was 90.9%. There was one ectopic pregnancy and one normal pregnancy during the 12 month observation period following insertion. The expulsion rate was .7. The removal rate was 6.1, mainly because of bleeding. There were no significant changes in the patients' laboratory test results during IUD use."
12277687,Intrauterine devices containing progesterone.,"Characteristics of progesterone-releasing IUDs are reported. At present, the only progesterone-containing IUD on the market is Progestasert, a T-shaped ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer device containing 38 mg progesterone in silicone. The device releases approximately 65 mcg/day into the uterine cavity over the course of 1-year. The device does not alter pituitary function or ovulation, nor does it depend on a local mechanical effect. Rather, it may exert its effect by inhibiting sperm capacitation or survival, or it may prevent nidation by alterning the endometrium. The reported pregnancy rate for Progestasert is 1.9% in parous women and 2.5% in nulliparous women. This efficacy rate is similar to that for other IUDs and low-dose progestin-only oral contraceptives. Breakthrough bleeding is the most common side effect, and perhaps 10-15% of the acceptors will have the device removed for either bleeding, pain, or infection. The rate of spontaneous expulsion of the device is about 3-8%. It is recommended that the device be inserted during or shortly after the menstrual period."
12260758,[New 2-step minidosage estro-progestagen contraceptive pill].,"A new 2-step minidosed pill (WY E 104) was administered to 135 patients for a total of 1606 cycles, and for a period of 6-26 months. 56.6% of patients could not tolerate traditional oral contraceptives, and 43.5% wanted oral contraception for the first time. There were not any pregnancies; there were 2 cases of amenorrhea, which disappeared spontaneously. In 79.5% of cases there was no breakthrough bleeding; spotting was observed in 20.5% of cases, but it also disappeared spontaneously. There were no problems concerning blood coagulation or lipid metabolism. A small percentage of patients gained weight. 14 patients terminated the treatment for personal reasons, and 8 for medical reasons. Most patients who had been on oral contraception with other products declared themselves completely satisfied with WY E 104, stating to tolerate it better than other products. Due to its particularly low dosage, to its effectiveness, and to the beneficial effects of the 2-step administration, WY E 104 seems to be particularly indicated to young women who are not acneic, and to premenopausal women."
964914,[Copper-7 intrauterine device (Gravigard). Report of experience].,"Within 2 years 258 women aged 16 to 42 years were fitted with a copper-7-IUD (Gravigard, Searle). 45% of these patients were nulliparous women. Follow-up studies were provided in 236 cases in a total of 2717 women-months according to an average time of observation of 11.5 women-months per patient. Altogether there occurred 5 unwanted pregnancies with a Pearl-Index of 2.3. Partial or total expulsion occurred in 27 cases (11%). Fourteen out of 27 expulsions were noticed within the first 2 months after insertion. Removals for medical reasons were requested in 36 cases-in the majority (26 cases) because of bleeding and pain. Thirteen women desired removal of the IUD in order to get either pregnant or sterilized. The continuation rate after 2 years was 73%. The highest number of drop-outs occurred within the first year after insertion (60 cases = 23%) whereas only 4% drop-outs occurred in the 2nd year. It was suggested that the low continuation rate might be partially due to the high number of physicians (19) participating in this study. The most important side effects of the copper-7-IUD in situ were irregular bleeding, intermenstrual pain and discharge. Irregular bleeding and pain decreased markedly after the first year, while slightly prolonged periods persisted in 30 to 50% of all patients. Compared with oral contraceptives copper IUDs hav less severe side effects but less safety at the same time-especially for the younger fertile age group. Therefore they should be offered to young nulliparous women only for a limited period of time.
Clinical experiences with the copper-7-IUD (Gravigard) in 258 women aged 16-42 years are reported. 45% of the patients were nulliparous women. Follow-up was possible in 236 cases, a total of 2717 women-months ( average of 11.5 woman-months per patient). 5 unwanted pregnancies (Pear l-Index of 2.3) were seen. Partial or total expulsion occurred in 27 cases (11%). 14 of 27 expulsions were noticed within the first 2 months after insertion. Removals for medical reasons were requested in 36 cases; in the majority (26 cases) because of bleeding and pain. 13 women desired removal of the IUD in order to get either pregnant or sterilized. The continuation rate after 2 years was 73%. The highest number of dropouts occurred within the 1st year after insertion (60 cases=23%) whereas only 4% dropouts occurred in the 2nd year.

Therefore they should be offered to young nulliparous women only for a limited period of time."
961166,[Hormonal contraception--throboembolism and surgical risk].,"Epidemiological, coagulational, haemodynamical, and morphological studies are critically analysed in this review. Our attitude about the surgical operation risk under hormonal contraceptives is explained. In smaller operative measures there musn't be a break in hormonal contraception. Planned greater operations are to performe only 4 to 6 weeks after cessation of hormonal contraceptives, i.e., after the first spontaneous menstrual bleeding. Hints for the necessity greater operations without a removal after pill or an additional risk factors are given.
The literature on the epidemiology, morphology, hemodynamic, and physiopathology of thromboembolism associated with oral contraception is reviewed. The correlation between oral contraceptives and increased risk of thromboembolic disease has been confirmed by many studies. Oral contraceptives may influence blood coagulation chemistry, the vessel wall, and the blood flow rate; even after medication is stopped, the risk of thromboembolism may continue to be high. It is recommended that hormonal contraception be discontinued several weeks before major surgery and not resumed for several months. For emergency surgery, especially in high-risk patients, preventive measures are strongly indicated."
4596680,Current status of contraceptive steroids and the intrauterine device.,"The present status of oral contraceptive steroids and the IUD, the 2 most effective and increasingly popular contraceptive methods (used by 41.6% of all U.S. married couples practicing contraception in 1970), is presented. Oral steroid contraceptives with varying quantity and activity of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol or mestranol) and progestogen (norethindrone, norethynodrel, ethynodiol diacetate, or norgestrel), are of 3 types: combination, sequential, and minidose progestogen alone. The most effective contraceptive available is the combined oral pill with a pregnancy rate of less than .2 % per 100 women after 1 year. Contraceptive action is exerted primarily through inhibition of ovulation and secondarily by alterations in cervical mucus, endometrial glands, the ovary, and in the oviduct and uterine muscle. In comparison, sequential oral contraceptives are less effective with greater side effects, and should only be used in women with amenorrhea. Effects of oral contraceptives other than contraception include those on the (1) the primary targets of the female reproductive system, (2) on other endocrine oragans and (3) on the remainder of the body. In the first group, changes may include transitory stromal fibrosis in the ovary, enlarged fibromyomata, intermenstrual bleeding or amenorrhea, increased amount of cervical mucus, polypoid hyperplasia of the endocervical glands, breast tenderness, and changes in lactation. Changes in the second category which may occur affect the adrenal glands, hypothalamus, the thyroid (increased thyroid-binding globulin), and pancreas (alterations in glucose metabolism). Effects on the rest of the body may include increase in serum lipids and changed atherogenic index, abnormalities in liver function, thromboembolism (incidence in oral contraceptive users 4.4 times that in non-users), melasma, alterations in the central nervous system with increased incidence of cerebral vascular accidents, hypertension, and increased body weight. Absolute contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy include cancer of the breast and uterus, pregnancy, active liver disease, hyperlipidemia, and history of gestational diabetes, thromboembolic phenomena or coronary artery disease. Relative contraindications include depression, migraine, myomata of the uterus, hypertension, epilipsy, oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. Reliable epidemiologic data on IUDs from the Cooperative Statistical Program indicated first year pregnancy rate of 2.5%. Problems with the IUD include: 1) pregnancy with device in situ, which is associated with a higher incidence of spontaneous abortion; 2) ectopic pregnancy, which is prevented at a rate of only 90% compared with intrauterine pregnancies prevented in 97-98%; and 3) expulsions (20% of which are unnoticed), the expulsion rate being higher with decreasing age and parity, higher in the first than second year of use, and higher with smaller than larger devices. A major problem is discontinuation for medical reasons (15% rate in the first year), mainly bleeding and pain. Perforation, another serious complication, occurs initially at time of insertion with an incidence of 1 per 2500 insertions for the loop. IUDs were found to produce a sterile inflammatory tissue reaction, which is postulated as the primary causative factor for their contraceptive effect in humans."
4642685,Endocrinological studies in two patients with post contraceptive cyclic dysfunction.,"Serial assays of urinary estrogens, pregnanediol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH), WERE PERFORMED IN 2 NORMAL women who developed amenorrhea as a result of oral contraceptive use. Case 1, a woman aged 28 with 2 children took Ovulen (mestranol .1 mg and ethynodiol diacetate 1.0 mg) for 25 months followed by a substitution of chlormadinone acetate (.5 mg per day) when she developed increased menstrual irregularity. Following withdrawal of the medication, vaginal bleeding began and lasted 4 days, and she experienced regular cycles for the subsequent 2 years. The second woman aged 21 developed amenorrhea after 17 months' use of Gynovlar (ethinyl estradiol .05 mg and norethistrone acetate 3.0 mg). Amenorrheic for 21 months at the time of investigation, she was given clomiphene citrate for 5 days (50 mg/day). Further treatment with clomiphene and Pergonal (Serono-Rome) was necessary to resume normal cycles and permit conception which led to full term delivery. Estrogen levels were similar to those of the follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle; however, they rose spontaneously to midcycle levels in case 1 and as a result of clomiphene treatment in case 2. FSH levels were normal but failed to show consistent patterns; LH patterns were highly irregular in both cases. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that longterm therapy by oral contraceptives may cause irregular cyclic release of gonadotrophins at the hypothalamic level resulting in amenorrhea and anovulation."
5578152,Problems with contraception in adolescents. The successful use of an intrauterine device.,"The use of intrauterine contraceptive devices to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies among 155 adolescents at the Adolecent Clinic of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center is described. The girls participating in the program from 1965 to 1971 were predominantly black, ranging in age from 11-20 years. Patients and parents were counselled about contraceptive methods, and if the IUD was chosen, its function and use were explained. An IUD was usually recommended for those patients who had a medical contraindication to oral contraceptives, in cases of other method failure, or in cases of lack of motivation or ability to follow instructions. Of 91 insertions of the Lippes loop IUD, there were 50 spontaneous expulsions. The high expulsion rate was a serious deterrent to proper patient motivation. In 1968 the program began using the Majzlin Spring, a stainless steel accordion-like device. 60 insertions were performed with this device and only 3 expulsions have been reported in follow-up ranging from 5 to 18 months. 1 uterine perforation occurred, believed due to problems with early postpartum insertion. 17 removals for infection or bleeding were necessary with the Lippes loop, and 8 with the Majzlin Spring. The pregnancy failure rate for the loop was 2.2% and 1.6% for the spring. The Majzlin device was also noticeably well retained by patients who had expelled other IUDs, but one-third of the patients with the spring device experienced significant postinsertion bleeding. The Majzlin Spring appears to be a highly acceptable contraceptive method for adolescents who fail to handle other means of preventing pregnancy, provided careful clinic observations are maintained."
5352596,Incidence of side effects with contraceptive placebo.,"147 Mexican women, of low socioeconomic level, who had aborted spontaneously and desired pregnancy, were subjected to trial of placebo oral contraceptive. In 424 months there were 72 pregnancies, a Pearl index of 203.8 pregnancies per 100 couple-years. Menstrual cycles lasted 21-24 days in 30 women (9.8%), 25-35 days in 235 (76.8%), and 36-59 days in 38 (12.4%). 18 cycles (5.8%) were marked by intermenstrual bleeding. Incidence of 31 side effects is listed. Most common were: decreased libido 125 months (29.5%), headache 66 (15.6%), lower abdominal pain and bloating 58 (13.7%), dizziness 47 (11.1%). Common complaints were nervousness, increased libido, dysmenorrhea, nausea, epigastric pain, leg pain, leukorrhea, somnolence. Oral contraceptive-like side effects reported in fewer than 1% of months included acne, mastalgia, increased appetite, weight gain, painful varicose veins. Nausea (here 4.2% of months) was the only side effect with markedly different incidence from other studies with active oral contraceptives."

34893080,Proposed protocol for treatment of severe periodontitis without platelet transfusion in patients with aplastic anemia: a case report.,"Aplastic anemia is an intractable disease characterized by pancytopenia, susceptibility to infection, and difficulty in achieving hemostasis. In patients with severe periodontal disease and aplastic anemia, spontaneous bleeding from the gingival tissue due to thrombocytopenia and during brushing is common, which may further exacerbate dental issues. Comprehensive periodontal treatment for patients with aplastic anemia is highly challenging and requires collaboration with a hematologist. Here, we discuss the case of a patient with aplastic anemia and severe periodontitis who was successfully treated in collaboration with our hematology department.
A 36-year-old Japanese woman with chief complaints of spontaneous gingival bleeding, pain, and increasing tooth mobility consulted our department. She had developed pancytopenia at age 11 years and was later diagnosed with aplastic anemia, making her susceptible to infection due to leukopenia. The results of the initial periodontal examination led to a diagnosis of severe generalized periodontitis (generalized stage IV grade C periodontitis) caused by leukopenia and poor oral hygiene. We adopted a comprehensive treatment plan, including invasive dental procedures. The patient exhibited no postoperative bleeding due to aplastic anemia-induced thrombocytopenia and experienced a good outcome.
Both physicians and dentists should be aware that immunocompromised patients with aplastic anemia are at risk of developing severe periodontitis with severe alveolar bone resorption if the condition is combined with poor oral hygiene. Even in the presence of aplastic anemia, patients with severe periodontitis can undergo comprehensive dental treatment, including dental extraction and periodontal surgery, if bleeding and susceptibility to infection are controlled. This requires the cooperation of the patient and hematologists and can ultimately contribute to improving the patient's quality of life."
34709773,Angina bullosa hemorrhagica: report of two cases.,"Angina bullosa hemorrhagica (ABH) is a rare benign condition that affects the oral and oropharyngeal mucosa. It is characterized by a rapid eruption of one or more red or magenta blood-filled bullae, which typically involves the soft palate. ABH is a self-limiting condition that heals spontaneously usually within 2 weeks without scarring. ABH is not related to any dermatologic, hematologic, systemic disorders, or other known causes. The etiopathogeneses of ABH are unknown, though several theories have been proposed. Trauma has been suggested as a potential cause for the development of ABH in susceptible individuals. Two cases are presented of AB﻿H, and the differential diagnoses of oral vesiculobullous conditions is discussed. Cognizance and identification of this benign condition is important to prevent misdiagnosis and eventual unwarranted treatment."
33430632,Thrombocytopenia and Clinical Outcomes in Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study.,"The impact of platelets on hematoma enlargement (HE) of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is not yet sufficiently elucidated. Especially the role of reduced platelet counts on HE and clinical outcomes is still poorly understood. This study investigated the influence of thrombocytopenia on HE, functional outcome, and mortality in patients with ICH with or without prior antiplatelet therapy (APT).
Individual participant data of multicenter cohort studies (multicenter RETRACE program [German-Wide Multicenter Analysis of Oral Anticoagulation-Associated Intracerebral Hemorrhage] and single-center UKER-ICH registry [Universitätsklinikum Erlangen Cohort of Patients With Spontaneous ICH]) were grouped into APT and non-APT ICH patients according to the platelet count, that is, with or without thrombocytopenia (cells <150×10
Of overall 2252 ICH patients, 11.4% (52 of 458) under APT and 14.0% (242 of 1725) without APT presented with thrombocytopenia on admission. The proportion of patients with HE was not significantly different between patients with or without thrombocytopenia among APT and non-APT ICH patients after propensity score matching (HE: APT patients: 9 of 40 [22.5%] thrombocytopenia versus 27 of 115 [23.5%] nonthrombocytopenia, 
Our study implies that thrombocytopenia does not affect rates of HE and functional outcome among ICH patients, neither in patients with nor without APT. In light of increased mortality, the significance of platelet transfusions for ICH patients with thrombocytopenia and previous APT should be explored in future studies."
31273088,Eltrombopag for the treatment of inherited thrombocytopenias: a phase II clinical trial.,"Patients with inherited thrombocytopenias often require platelet transfusions to raise their platelet count before surgery or other invasive procedures; moreover, subjects with clinically significant spontaneous bleeding may benefit from an enduring improvement of thrombocytopenia. The hypothesis that thrombopoietin-mimetics can increase platelet count in inherited thrombocytopenias is appealing, but evidence is scarce. We conducted a prospective, phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the oral thrombopoietin-mimetic eltrombopag in different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. We enrolled 24 patients affected by "
30666067,Oral Manifestation as the Main Sign of an Advanced Stage Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive malignant neoplasm occurring mainly in elderly, with the median age of 65 years. Oral manifestations, mainly spontaneous bleeding, are a common finding in acute myelocytic leukemia and may represent the initial evidence of the disease. This report describes a case of a 47-year-old man with a one-month history of spontaneous oral bleeding. The patient had already been consulted by two professionals but he remained undiagnosed. The physical examination revealed paleness, fever, epistaxis and ecchymoses in the oral mucosa. The complete blood count revealed anemia, severe thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis with blasts predominance, reinforcing the diagnosis hypothesis of an acute leukemia. The patient was immediately referred to the Hospital and despite having received a quick intervention, he died 3 days after the admission due to diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. According to the peripheral blood immunophenotyping the diagnosis of hypogranular variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established. The delay in the diagnosis may have influenced the unfavorable outcome. Early diagnosis and management are indispensable for survival of leukemia patients. In this way, dentists may be responsible for an early detection of oral manifestations of leukemia and for a fast referral to an adequate professional."
29269984,Clinical feature and management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura in a tertiary hospital in Northwest Nigeria.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a rare bleeding disorder that may remit spontaneously. Life-threatening bleeding may require transfusion support, steroids, and other immunosuppressive therapy or splenectomy.
To review the clinical presentation and laboratory features of ITP at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Zaria, Nigeria.
A retrospective analytic study of case notes and bone marrow (BM) records of patients diagnosed with ITP at Haematology Department, ABUTH, Zaria, from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012.
There were nine cases (six females, three males), aged 6-20 (mean 11.11) years. The presentations were epistaxis 8 (88.9%), purpura 4 (44.4%), gum bleeding 4 (44.4%), menorrhagia 2 (22.2%), and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) 1 (11.1%). Only 1 (11.1%) had clinical splenomegaly. Platelet count of <20 × 10
ITP is not common in our center though its clinical presentations are varied. However, prednisolone and blood transfusion therapy are central to the management of these patients with favorable outcome."
29158366,Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Patients with Primary Brain Tumors or Secondary Brain Metastasis.,"Patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors are at increased risk of developing venous thromboses. However, the potential benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation in these patients must be weighed against the deadly complication of intracranial hemorrhage. In this review, we summarize available evidence and recent studies of intracranial bleeding risks in primary and metastatic tumors and the impact of therapeutic anticoagulation. We find that for the majority of primary and treated metastatic brain tumors, the risk of spontaneous bleeding is acceptable and not further increased by careful therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or direct oral anticoagulants, although thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/μL) and other coagulopathies are relative contraindications. Patients with brain metastasis from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma have a higher tendency to bleed spontaneously than noted in patients with other malignancies, and thus warrant routine brain imaging and alternative strategies such as inferior vena cava filter placement in the acute setting of venous thromboembolism before consideration of therapeutic anticoagulation.
Malignant gliomas are associated with increased risks of both venous thromboses and intracranial hemorrhage, but the additional bleeding risk associated with therapeutic anticoagulation appears acceptable, especially after treatment of primary tumors. Most patients with treated brain metastasis have a low risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation, and low molecular weight heparin is currently the preferred agent of choice. Patients with untreated brain metastasis from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, choriocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma have a higher propensity for spontaneous intracranial bleeding, and systemic anticoagulation may be contraindicated in the acute setting of venous thromboembolism."
29148688,Spontaneous Oral Mucosal Bleeding Unmasking Undiagnosed Sarcoidosis: A Case Report.,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, non-caseating, chronic, granulomatous disease affecting any organ. In the head and neck region, salivary glands and lymph nodes are most commonly involved. Oral manifestations are rare but these lesions, occasionally haemorrhagic, may be the first sign of systemic disease. It is important to recognize the oral manifestations of sarcoidosis and to be aware of potential secondary disease-driven processes, such as thrombocytopenia. The purpose of this paper is to present a previously undiagnosed case of sarcoidosis, initially presenting with oral manifestations, including mucosal bleeding, and to review the current literature on oral sarcoidosis. Clinical relevance: Oral lesions can be the first sign of undiagnosed systemic sarcoidosis."
22348185,Successful treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonist in avoiding splenectomy for patients with chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenia.,"Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a condition associated with significant morbidity; however the management options are often unsatisfactory with a portion of patients exhibiting a refractory-relapsing disease path despite various lines of treatment including splenectomy. As a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, eltrombopag (GlaxoSmithKline, Australia) provides a novel treatment option for patients with refractory disease. We describe the outcomes of four patients with chronic ITP, who were treated with eltrombopag as a single agent.
Four Caucasian patients with chronic refractory ITP (2 males; 2 females) were enrolled in this study with a mean age of 48 years (range, 39-59). All patients were non-splenectomised and were refractory to several lines of treatment including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, vincristine, and azathioprine, one patient has also received rituximab (a monoclonal antibody that binds the CD20 antigen expressed by B-lymphocytes). All patients were treated with oral eltrombopag (50-75 mg) for a median period of 12 months (range, 9-16).
After a median follow up of 20 months (range, 11-34), platelet counts recovered to normal levels in two patients. One recovered a normal platelet count after 13 months, the other 34 months of completion of treatment with eltrombopag. No additional immune suppressive therapy was required. The other two patients also discontinued eltrombopag at 27 and 11 months after achievement of satisfactory platelet counts above 30/nL without any bleeding complications. Other forms of immune therapy were also ceased in these two cases. None of the four patients required splenectomy.
The clinical outcomes in this small cohort of patients suggests that eltrombopag may have a role to play in the long term control of chronic ITP whilst avoiding splenectomy and long term immunosuppressive therapy. The beneficial outcomes in our patients led to a sustained elevation in platelets with no adverse effects noted when used for relatively longer periods than previously reported. It is worth noting that spontaneous remission does occur with ITP and is the most likely cause for the favourable outcome with eltrombopag therapy. However, if eltrombopag is able to reduce the need for splenectomy in patients with chronic ITP then a distinct quality of care outcome can be achieved by avoiding the recognised short- and long-term complications of splenectomy. Randomised controlled trials with long-term follow up are warranted."
20217108,Fetal genotyping for platelets antigens: a precise tool for alloimmune thrombocytopenia: case report and literature review.,"Maternal-fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia complicates about 0.1% of all pregnancies and is associated with major fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially spontaneous central nervous system bleeding leading to death and neurological handicaps. Successful prevention and treatment depend on the identification of at-risk possible carriers of anti-platelet antibodies.
We report a case of a mother with a previous child that developed neonatal hemorrhage; HPA-5b anti-platelet antibodies were detected post-natally. During the next pregnancy, fetal genotyping confirmed the presence of HPA-5b antigen; she was treated with weekly intravenous human immunoglobulin and oral prednisone. Pregnancy evolved without remarkable features and a full-term baby was delivered, with normal platelet counts.
Fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is a potentially lethal condition, but early detection and prevention lead to successful outcome in most cases."
18410425,Rapidly involuting congenital haemangioma associated with transient thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy: a case series.,"Rapidly involuting congenital haemangioma (RICH) may present with thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen and elevated fibrin degradation products and D-dimers. Such complications have rarely been reported. We wished to define the clinical characteristics of the thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy associated with RICH, to emphasize the transient nature of this haematological complication and to distinguish these abnormalities from true Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP). We present a case series of seven patients with large RICH who presented with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy during the first week of life. Clinical and haematological characteristics were recorded retrospectively. Two of the patients were treated with embolization due to early signs of high-output cardiac failure; four patients received oral corticosteroids in the range of 2 mg kg(-1) daily; one patient did not receive any treatment in the neonatal period, although the tumour was excised at 6 months of age. Two patients with platelet counts lower than 10 x 10(9) L(-1) received a platelet transfusion. There were no bleeding complications and only one patient presented with petechiae. In all seven patients, platelet counts started to increase at > 2 weeks of age and the coagulopathy resolved. We conclude that RICH may present with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy similar to mild KMP early in the neonatal period. However, in contrast to true KMP, these abnormal laboratory findings are self-limited and are usually not complicated by bleeding problems."
16425853,[Haemorrhagic colitis in a young male after the use of amoxicillin].,"A 16-year-old boy had rectal blood loss due to haemorrhagic colitis probably resulting from oral and intravenous administration of amoxicillin. He also had haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, both also most likely resulting from the use of amoxicillin and/or ibuprofen. In the week following the discontinuation of amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the symptoms of bloody diarrhoea disappeared spontaneously and the blood picture became normal. Haemorrhagic colitis is a known side effect of amoxicillin that is rarely seen. Discontinuation of treatment typically results in a quick and uneventful recovery."
15331001,Dental treatment for children with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura: a report of two cases.,"Idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP) is the most common acquired bleeding disorder occurring in previously healthy children. The condition is benign and self-limiting, with a high possibility of recovery. Only 15-30% of children with acute ITP develop the chronic form. Clinically, ITP presents with petechiae, ecchymoses, haematomas, epistaxis, haematuria, mucocutaneous bleeding, and occasionally, haemorrhage into tissues. Oral manifestations include spontaneous gingival bleeding, petechiae or haematomas of the mucosa, tongue or palate. Two paediatric case reports are described concerning female patients diagnosed with chronic ITP. Oral findings and dental procedures are described. Standard dental treatment was performed with a platelet count higher than 50,000/mm3. The importance of adequate dental plaque control techniques in order to prevent inflammation, potential bleeding and infection in these patients is emphasized. The paediatric dentist must be aware of the clinical appearance of ITP in order to recognize the condition and successfully manage the patient."
14565801,Treatment of pediatric idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis with low-dose cyclophosphamide.,"To report the safety and efficacy of long-term, low-dose cyclophosphamide therapy in a child with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH).
A 7-year-old boy diagnosed with IPH 4 years previously was initially prescribed prednisolone. Because he only had a transient response to prednisolone, oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/d was later added. A dramatic improvement was noted during the subsequent follow-up. One year after cyclophosphamide therapy, the patient suddenly developed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 75 x 10(3)/mm(3)), with the platelet count decreasing to 10 x 10(3)/mm(3) over the following 10 months. Cyclophosphamide was tapered to an alternating daily dosage of 1 mg/kg. The tapering resulted in a subsequent increase in the platelet count, which was maintained between 20 and 50 x 10(3)/mm(3) without occurrence of petechiae or spontaneous bleeding. Under this reduced dosing regimen, the disease has remained in remission for >1 year.
Due to the low prevalence of IPH, only limited data document the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy in treating this disease. Although our patient showed a good response to low-dose cyclophosphamide, he developed thrombocytopenia with its use. The mechanism is unclear, but it may be similar to that of high-dose cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression. Due to the development of thrombocytopenia, the use of cyclophosphamide was maintained under a reduced dosing regimen. The benefit of long-term immunosuppressive therapy is controversial, and more clinical evidence is required to support its continued usage.
Long-term, low-dose cyclophosphamide is effective in treating childhood IPH, but caution should be exercised due to the possible development of thrombocytopenia. Periodic monitoring of the platelet count in long-term treatment is recommended."
10650374,Spontaneous gingival bleeding in an otherwise asymptomatic patient.,"This case is presented to challenge the reader to formulate a differential diagnosis for a patient who visits the dentist with spontaneous, continuous gingival bleeding. When this situation occurs, it is serious and requires immediate attention and a specific treatment plan to arrive at the underlying diagnosis and control the bleeding. The signs and symptoms of a patient with gingival bleeding are presented for diagnosis; the history and management are detailed, and may be useful in diagnosing and treating similar patients."
10234876,Treatment of acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in children. A retrospective evaluation of 120 cases.,"Acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP) in children is generally a benign disease with a high frequency of spontaneous remission. Nevertheless the debate over treating or not is still open, because of the high risk of hemorrhage as long as the platelet count remains below 20 x 10(9)/l. We have retrospectively evaluated 120 pediatric cases from our center, receiving different treatments at diagnosis: no treatment (76); IVIG: 400 mg/kg/d for 5 days (28); continuous oral PDN: 1-1.5 mg/kg/d for at least two weeks (16). No patients had been previously treated for AITP. Follow-up is up to fifty months. We found no significant differences as to the percentage of responses among the three groups. We conclude that waiting without treatment is safe and appropriate in most cases; whether the hemorrhagic risk suggests treatment, standard dose continuous oral PDN and IVIG may be equally effective, but IVIG may achieve a significantly faster rise in the platelet count. The timing of treatment and the cost/benefit ratio are discussed."
8675111,[Bleeding due to platelet dysfunction as a presenting symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus].,"A 32-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of fever, blurred vision in the left eye, nasal and gingival bleeding and arthralgia. There was a macular hemorrhage, a tender mass in the left lower abdomen and edema of both legs. She also had anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, platelet function abnormalities, kidney dysfunction, and albuminuria. Serology was positive for antinuclear antibodies and double-stranded DNA; complement level was low, and circulating anticoagulants were present. Kidney biopsy established the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Abdominal sonography demonstrated perisplenic and pelvic bleeding. A pulse therapy of corticosteroids with low-dose oral cyclophosphamide, along with platelet transfusions and infusions of deamino-d-arginine vasopressin resulted in symptomatic and laboratory improvement. Bleeding stopped, platelet function became normal, kidney function tests returned to normal and she became seronegative. It is emphasized that platelet function abnormalities are rare in SLE. The thrombocytopenia was too mild to cause spontaneous bleeding, and lupus anticoagulant is usually associated with thromboembolic complications and not with spontaneous bleeding. It is therefore conceivable that in this case platelet function abnormalities were responsible for the spontaneous bleeding, the presenting sign which led to establishing the diagnosis."
2231437,"Orofacial manifestations from accidental exposure to caesium 137 in Goiania, Brazil.","The accidental close exposure of over 200 adults and children to a caesium-137 (137Cs) source in Goiania, Brazil in 1987 produced significant short-term morbidity in about 50 patients, and four deaths within a few weeks. Some 57% of those maximally exposed to radiation, developed orofacial lesions, notably purpura, spontaneous bleeding, ulcers and/or acute candidiasis. These lesions were probably mainly the consequences of depression of bone marrow elements by the radionuclide. Though the oral lesions that may follow iatrogenic exposure to ionizing radiation are well recognized this appears to be the first report on the oral sequelae of a serious radiation accident."
3186382,Thrombocytopenia and human immunodeficiency virus in children.,"Thrombocytopenia occurs in 13% of children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The clinical and laboratory course of 19 children infected with HIV with thrombocytopenia is described. Bone marrow aspirates showed normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes. Levels of antiplatelet antibodies were increased in 80% of the children and circulating immune complexes were found in 74%. Clinically significant hemorrhage leading to anemia occurred in five patients, and CNS bleeding led to a fatal outcome in an additional three children. Spontaneous remission of thrombocytopenia occurred in three of the 19 subjects. High-dose IV gamma-globulin was effective in increasing the platelet counts of six of 15 patients (40%) but resulted in a sustained remission in only one subject. Oral prednisone was effective in increasing the platelet count of two thirds of those whose platelet counts could not be controlled by IV gamma-globulin. Bleeding manifestations were eliminated in all patients whose platelet counts increased significantly. Of the 11 children whose counts increased either spontaneously or as a result of therapy, eight remain alive (72%). In contrast, all of the eight patients whose platelet counts did not improve have died. Thrombocytopenia in children with HIV disease is engendered by immune mechanisms and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. High-dose IV gamma-globulin and/or corticosteroids are temporarily effective in increasing the platelet count and reducing bleeding in about half of thrombocytopenic patients and are recommended for use. The ability to respond to therapy correlates with improved survival."
36159357,A Case of Spontaneous Perinephric Hematoma From Rivaroxaban.,"Spontaneous perinephric hematoma is an uncommon but serious condition that is typically caused by tumor hemorrhage or vascular disease such as polyarteritis nodosa. We describe a 78-year-old Chinese gentleman with underlying chronic kidney disease, renal cysts, non-obstructive renal stones, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and atrial fibrillation who was on rivaroxaban and clopidogrel. He developed spontaneous perinephric hematoma complicated by acute kidney injury, anemia, and myocardial infarction who underwent angioembolization and packed cell transfusion. He did not have further bleeding episodes, and his kidney function improved before discharge."

Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation, has previously been associated with atraumatic solid organ rupture but, to date, no case of apixaban-related Wunderlich syndrome has been reported. We report a rare case of Wunderlich syndrome associated with apixaban while addressing the difficulties face by clinicians when managing anticoagulation in bleeding patients.

Reportamos um caso raro de síndrome de Wunderlich associada ao apixabano abordando concomitantemente as dificuldades na gestão da anticoagulação em doentes com hemorragia."
31985838,Ibuprofen for the prevention of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Indomethacin has been the standard treatment to close a PDA but is associated with renal, gastrointestinal, and cerebral side effects. Ibuprofen has less effect on blood flow velocity to important organs.
Primary objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo/no intervention, or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in the prevention of PDA in preterm infants.
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 17 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 17 October 2018), and CINAHL; 1982 to 17 October 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.
We extracted outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three or four of life (after 72 hours of treatment), need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications. We performed meta-analyses and reported treatment estimates as typical mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or to harm (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed between-study heterogeneity by the I-squared test (I²). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.
In this updated analysis, we included nine trials (N = 1070 infants) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen (IV or oral) with placebo/no intervention or indomethacin. Ibuprofen (IV or oral) probably decreases the risk of PDA on day 3 or 4 (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.48; typical RD -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.21; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 9 trials; N = 1029) (moderate-quality evidence). In the control group, the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day 3 to 4 of age. In addition, ibuprofen probably decreases the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (typical RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26; typical RD -0.27, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.22; NNTB 4; 95% CI 3 to 5),and the need for surgical ductal ligation (typical RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to infinity; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). There was a possible decrease in the risk of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in infants receiving prophylactic ibuprofen (typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 34%; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to- 0.00; I² = 60%; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). High quality evidence showed increased risk for oliguria (typical RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.02; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; NNTH 17, 95% CI 9 to 100; 4 trials; N = 747). Low quality results from four studies (N = 202) showed that administering oral ibuprofen may decrease the risk of PDA (typical RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74) and may increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNTH 7, 95% CI 4 to 25). No evidence of a difference was identified for mortality, any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), or chronic lung disease.
This review shows that prophylactic use of ibuprofen, compared to placebo or no intervention, probably decreases the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and for surgical ductal closure. Adverse effects associated with ibuprofen (IV or oral) included increased risks for oliguria, increase in serum creatinine levels, and increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. There was a reduced risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III - IV) but no evidence of a difference in mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, or time to reach full feeds. In the control group, the patent ductus arteriosus had closed spontaneously by day 3 or 4 in 58% of neonates. Prophylactic treatment exposes a large proportion of infants unnecessarily to a drug that has important side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits. Current evidence does not support the use of ibuprofen for prevention of patent ductus arteriosus. Until long-term follow-up results of the trials included in this review have been published, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended. A new approach to patent ductus arteriosus management is an early targeted treatment based on echocardiographic criteria within the first 72 hours of life, that have a high sensitivity for diagnosing a patent ductus arteriosus that is unlikely to close spontaneously. Such trials are currently ongoing in many parts of the world. Results of such trials will be included in updates of our ""Ibuprofen for treatment of PDA"" review.
La persistance du canal artériel (PCA) complique l'évolution clinique des prématurés et augmente le risque d'effets indésirables. L'indométhacine a été le traitement standard pour fermer une PCA, mais elle est associée à des effets secondaires rénaux, gastro‐intestinaux et cérébraux. L'ibuprofène a moins d'effet sur la vitesse du flux sanguin vers les organes importants.
Objectifs principaux Déterminer l'efficacité et l'innocuité de l'ibuprofène par rapport au placebo/aucune intervention ou à d'autres inhibiteurs de la cyclo‐oxygénase dans la prévention de la PCA chez les prématurés. STRATÉGIE DE RECHERCHE DOCUMENTAIRE: Nous avons utilisé la stratégie de recherche standard de Cochrane Neonatal pour faire des recherches dans le Registre central des essais contrôlés de Cochrane (CENTRAL ; 2018, numéro 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 au 17 octobre 2018), Embase (1980 au 17 octobre 2018) et CINAHL ; 1982 au 17 octobre 2018). Nous avons également effectué des recherches dans les bases de données d'essais cliniques, les actes de conférence, et les références bibliographiques d'articles sélectionnés pour identifier des essais contrôlés randomisés ou quasi randomisés. CRITÈRES DE SÉLECTION: Essais contrôlés randomisés et quasi‐randomisés comparant l'ibuprofène à un placebo/aucune intervention ou à d'autres inhibiteurs de la cyclo‐oxygénase pour prévenir les PCA chez les prématurés ou les nourrissons de faible poids à la naissance. RECUEIL ET ANALYSE DES DONNÉES: Nous avons extrait des données sur les critères de jugement, y compris la présence de PCA au troisième ou quatrième jour de vie (après 72 heures de traitement), la nécessité d'une ligature chirurgicale ou d'un traitement de secours avec des inhibiteurs de cyclo‐oxygénase, la mortalité, les complications cérébrales, rénales, pulmonaires et gastro‐intestinales. Nous avons effectué des méta‐analyses et reporté les estimations de traitement sous forme de différence moyenne typique (DM), de risque relatif (RR), de différence de risque (DR) et, si elles sont statistiquement significatives, de nombre de sujets à traiter pour en retirer des bénéfices (NNTB) ou des préjudices (NNTH), ainsi que leurs intervalles de confiance (IC) à 95 %. Nous avons évalué l'hétérogénéité entre les études par le test du carré I (I²). Nous avons utilisé l'approche GRADE pour évaluer la qualité des données probantes. RÉSULTATS PRINCIPAUX: Dans cette analyse mise à jour, nous avons inclus neuf essais (N = 1070 nourrissons) comparant l'ibuprofène prophylactique (IV ou oral) avec placebo/aucune intervention ou l’indométhacine. L'ibuprofène (IV ou oral) diminue probablement le risque de PCA au jour 3 ou 4 (RR typique 0,39, IC à 95 % 0,31 à 0,48 ; DR typique ‐0,26, IC à 95 % ‐0,31 à ‐0,21 ; NNTB 4, IC à 95 % 3 à 5 ; 9 essais ; N = 1029) (données probantes de qualité moyenne). Dans le groupe témoin, le taux de fermeture spontanée était de 58 % au jour 3 ou 4. De plus, l'ibuprofène diminue probablement le besoin d'un traitement de secours avec des inhibiteurs de cyclo‐oxygénase (RR typique 0,17, IC à 95 % 0,11 à 0,26 ; DR typique ‐0,27, IC à 95 % ‐0,32 à ‐0,22 ; NSTB 4 ; IC à 95 % 3 à 5),et le besoin de ligature chirurgicale des canaux (RR typique 0,46, IC à 95 % 0,22 à 0,96 ; DR typique ‐0,03, IC à 95 % 0,05 à ‐0,00 ; NNTB 33, IC à 95 % 20 à infini ; 7 essais ; N = 925) (données probantes de qualité moyenne). On a observé une diminution possible du risque d'hémorragie intraventriculaire (HIV) de grade 3 ou 4 chez les nourrissons recevant de l'ibuprofène prophylactique (RR typique 0,67, IC à 95 % 0,45 à 1,00 ; I² = 34 % ; DR typique ‐0,04, IC à 95 % ‐0,08 à 0,00 ; I² = 60 % ; 7 essais ; N = 925) (données probantes de qualité moyenne). Des données probantes de haute qualité ont montré un risque accru d'oligurie (RR typique 1,45, IC à 95 % 1,04 à 2,02 ; DR typique 0,06, IC à 95 % 0,01 à 0,11 ; NNTH 17, IC à 95 % 9 à 100 ; 4 essais ; N = 747). Les résultats de faible qualité de quatre études (N = 202) ont montré que l'administration orale d'ibuprofène peut diminuer le risque de PCA (RR typique 0,47, IC à 95 % 0,30 à 0,74) et peut augmenter le risque de saignement gastro‐intestinal (NNTH 7, IC à 95 % 4 à 25). Aucune donnée probante montrant une différence n'a été relevée en ce qui concerne la mortalité, les hémorragies intraventriculaires (HIV) ou les maladies pulmonaires chroniques.
Cette revue montre que l'utilisation prophylactique de l'ibuprofène, comparativement au placebo ou à l'absence d'intervention, diminue probablement la persistance du canal artériel, la nécessité d'un traitement de secours avec des inhibiteurs de cyclo‐oxygénase et d'une fermeture chirurgicale du canal. Les effets indésirables associés à l'ibuprofène (par voie intraveineuse ou orale) comprenaient un risque accru d'oligurie, une augmentation des taux sériques de créatinine et un risque accru d'hémorragie gastro‐intestinale. Le risque d'hémorragie intraventriculaire (grade III ‐ IV) était réduit, mais il n'y avait aucun signe de différence dans la mortalité, les maladies pulmonaires chroniques, l'entérocolite nécrosante ou le délai pour se nourrir complètement. Dans le groupe témoin, la persistance du canal artériel s'était fermée spontanément au jour 3 ou 4 chez 58 % des nouveau‐nés. Le traitement prophylactique expose inutilement une grande proportion de nourrissons à un médicament qui a des effets secondaires importants sans leur procurer d'avantages importants à court terme. Les données probantes actuelles n'appuient pas l'utilisation de l'ibuprofène pour la prévention de la persistance du canal artériel. Jusqu'à ce que les résultats du suivi à long terme des essais inclus dans cette revue aient été publiés, aucun autre essai sur l'ibuprofène prophylactique n'est recommandé. Une nouvelle approche de la prise en charge de la persistance du canal artériel est un traitement précoce ciblé basé sur des critères échocardiographiques dans les 72 premières heures de la vie, qui présentent une sensibilité élevée pour le diagnostic d'une persistance du canal artériel dont la fermeture spontanée est peu probable. De tels essais sont actuellement en cours dans de nombreuses régions du monde. Les résultats de ces essais seront inclus dans les mises à jour de notre revue ""Ibuprofen pour le traitement de la PCA"".
El conducto arterioso persistente (CAP) complica el curso clínico de los lactantes prematuros y aumenta el riesgo de resultados adversos. La indometacina ha sido el tratamiento estándar para cerrar el CAP, pero se asocia con efectos secundarios renales, gastrointestinales y cerebrales. El ibuprofeno tiene menos efectos sobre la velocidad del flujo sanguíneo a los órganos importantes.
Objetivos primarios Determinar la efectividad y seguridad del ibuprofeno en comparación con el placebo, con la no intervención o con otros fármacos inhibidores de la ciclooxigenasa en la prevención del CAP en recién nacidos prematuros. MÉTODOS DE BÚSQUEDA: Se utilizó la estrategia de búsqueda estándar del Grupo Cochrane de Neonatología para buscar en el Registro Cochrane Central de Ensayos Controlados (CENTRAL 2018, número 10), MEDLINE vía PubMed (1966 hasta 17 octubre 2018), EMBASE (1980 hasta 17 octubre 2018) y en CINAHL (1982 hasta 17 octubre 2018). También se buscaron ensayos controlados aleatorizados y ensayos cuasialeatorizados en bases de datos de ensayos clínicos, actas de congresos y listas de referencias de los artículos recuperados. CRITERIOS DE SELECCIÓN: Ensayos controlados aleatorizados o cuasialeatorizados que compararon ibuprofeno con placebo o ninguna intervención o con otros fármacos inhibidores de la ciclooxigenasa para la prevención del CAP en lactantes prematuros o de bajo peso al nacer. OBTENCIÓN Y ANÁLISIS DE LOS DATOS: Se extrajeron datos de resultado, como la presencia del CAP al tercer o cuarto día de vida (después de 72 horas de tratamiento), la necesidad de ligadura quirúrgica o el tratamiento de rescate con inhibidores de la ciclooxigenasa, la mortalidad y las complicaciones cerebrales, renales, pulmonares y gastrointestinales. Se realizaron los metanálisis e informaron los cálculos de tratamiento como la diferencia de medias (DM) típica, los riesgos relativos (RR), la diferencia de riesgos (DR) y, si era estadísticamente significativo, el número necesario a tratar para lograr un beneficio (NNTB) o daño (NNTH), junto con los intervalos de confianza (IC) del 95%. Se evaluó la heterogeneidad entre estudios con la prueba de I cuadrado (I²). Se utilizaron los criterios GRADE para evaluar la calidad de la evidencia.
En este análisis actualizado, se incluyeron nueve ensayos (N = 1070 neonatos) que compararon el ibuprofeno profiláctico (i.v. u oral) con placebo o ninguna intervención o indometacina. El ibuprofeno (intravenoso u oral) probablemente disminuye el riesgo de CAP en el día 3 ó 4 (RR típico 0,39; IC del 95%: 0,31 a 0,48; DR típica ‐0,26; IC del 95%: ‐0,31 a ‐0,21; NNTB 4; IC del 95%: 3 a 5; nueve ensayos; N = 1029) (evidencia de calidad moderada). En el grupo de control, la tasa de cierre espontáneo fue de un 58% a los tres o cuatro días de vida. Además, el ibuprofeno probablemente disminuye la necesidad de tratamiento de rescate con inhibidores de la ciclooxigenasa (RR típico 0,17; IC del 95%: 0,11 a 0,26; DR típica ‐0,27; IC del 95%: ‐0,32 a ‐0).22; NNTB 4; IC del 95%: 3 a 5), y la necesidad de ligadura ductal quirúrgica (RR típico 0,46; IC del 95%: 0,22 a 0,96; DR típica ‐0,03; IC del 95%: ‐0,05 a ‐0,00; NNTB 33; IC del 95%: 20 a infinito; siete ensayos; N = 925) (evidencia de calidad moderada). Hubo una posible disminución en el riesgo de hemorragia intraventricular (Hiv) de grado 3 o 4 en los lactantes que recibieron ibuprofeno profiláctico (RR típico 0,67; IC del 95%: 0,45 a 1,00; I² = 34%; DR típica ‐0,04; IC del 95%: ‐0,08 a 0,00; I² = 60%; siete ensayos; N = 925) (evidencia de calidad moderada). La evidencia de alta calidad mostró un mayor riesgo de oliguria (RR típico 1,45; IC del 95%: 1,04 a 2,02; DR típica 0,06; IC del 95%: 0,01 a 0,11; NNTD 17; IC del 95%: 9 a 100; cuatro ensayos; N = 747). Los resultados de calidad baja de cuatro estudios (N = 202) demostraron que la administración de ibuprofeno oral puede reducir el riesgo de CAP (RR típico 0,47; IC del 95%: 0,30 a 0,74) y puede aumentar el riesgo de hemorragia gastrointestinal (NNTH 7; IC del 95%: 4 a 25). No se identificó evidencia de una diferencia en cuanto a la mortalidad, cualquier grado de hemorragia intraventricular (Hiv) o la enfermedad pulmonar crónica.
Esta revisión demuestra que el uso profiláctico de ibuprofeno, en comparación con placebo o ninguna intervención, probablemente disminuye la incidencia de conducto arterioso persistente, la necesidad de tratamiento de rescate con inhibidores de la ciclooxigenasa y de cierre ductal quirúrgico. Los efectos adversos asociados con el ibuprofeno (i.v. u oral) incluyeron mayor riesgo de oliguria, aumento de los niveles de creatinina sérica y mayor riesgo de hemorragia gastrointestinal. Se redujo el riesgo de hemorragia intraventricular (grado III ‐ IV), pero no hubo evidencia de una diferencia en la mortalidad, la enfermedad pulmonar crónica, la enterocolitis necrosante ni el tiempo hasta la alimentación enteral total. En el grupo de control, el conducto arterioso persistente se había cerrado espontáneamente al tercer o cuarto día de vida en un 58% de recién nacidos. El tratamiento profiláctico expone innecesariamente a un gran número de lactantes a un fármaco que tiene efectos secundarios importantes, sin ofrecer efectos beneficiosos importantes a corto plazo. La evidencia actual no apoya el uso del ibuprofeno para la prevención del conducto arterioso persistente. Hasta que se publiquen resultados del seguimiento a largo plazo de los ensayos incluidos en esta revisión, no se recomiendan ensayos adicionales de ibuprofeno profiláctico. Un nuevo enfoque terapéutico para el conducto arterioso persistente consiste en un tratamiento específico inicial sobre la base de criterios ecocardiográficos en las primeras 72 horas de vida, que tienen una sensibilidad alta para diagnosticar un conducto arterioso permeable que tiene poca probabilidad de cerrarse espontáneamente. Estos ensayos están actualmente en curso en muchos países. Los resultados de estos ensayos se incluirán en las actualizaciones de la revisión ""Ibuprofeno para el tratamiento del CAP""."
31222841,Ibuprofen for the prevention of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Indomethacin has been the standard treatment to close a PDA but is associated with renal, gastrointestinal, and cerebral side effects. Ibuprofen has less effect on blood flow velocity to important organs.
Primary objectivesTo determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo/no intervention, or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in the prevention of PDA in preterm infants.
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 17 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 17 October 2018), and CINAHL; 1982 to 17 October 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.
We extracted outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three or four of life (after 72 hours of treatment), need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications. We performed meta-analyses and reported treatment estimates as typical mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or to harm (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed between-study heterogeneity by the I-squared test (I²). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.
In this updated analysis, we included nine trials (N = 1070 infants) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen (IV or oral) with placebo/no intervention or indomethacin. Ibuprofen (IV or oral) probably decreases the risk of PDA on day 3 or 4 (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.48; typical RD -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.21; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 9 trials; N = 1029) (moderate-quality evidence). In the control group, the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day 3 to 4 of age. In addition, ibuprofen probably decreases the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (typical RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26; typical RD -0.27, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.22; NNTB 4; 95% CI 3 to 5),and the need for surgical ductal ligation (typical RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to infinity; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). There was a possible decrease in the risk of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in infants receiving prophylactic ibuprofen (typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 34%; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to- 0.00; I² = 60%; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). High quality evidence showed increased risk for oliguria (typical RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.02; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; NNTH 17, 95% CI 9 to 100; 4 trials; N = 747). Low quality results from four studies (N = 202) showed that administering oral ibuprofen may decrease the risk of PDA (typical RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74) and may increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNTH 7, 95% CI 4 to 25). No evidence of a difference was identified for mortality, any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), or chronic lung disease.
This review shows that prophylactic use of ibuprofen, compared to placebo or no intervention, probably decreases the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and for surgical ductal closure. Adverse effects associated with ibuprofen (IV or oral) included increased risks for oliguria, increase in serum creatinine levels, and increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. There was a reduced risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III - IV) but no evidence of a difference in mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, or time to reach full feeds. In the control group, the patent ductus arteriosus had closed spontaneously by day 3 or 4 in 58% of neonates. Prophylactic treatment exposes a large proportion of infants unnecessarily to a drug that has important side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits. Current evidence does not support the use of ibuprofen for prevention of patent ductus arteriosus. Until long-term follow-up results of the trials included in this review have been published, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended.A new approach to patent ductus arteriosus management is an early targeted treatment based on echocardiographic criteria within the first 72 hours of life, that have a high sensitivity for diagnosing a patent ductus arteriosus that is unlikely to close spontaneously. Such trials are currently ongoing in many parts of the world. Results of such trials will be included in updates of our ""Ibuprofen for treatment of PDA"" review."
30042285,[Renal Cancer after Spontaneous Rupture Successfully Treated with Low-Dose Oral UFT - A Case Report].,"A 94-year-old man, who had been diagnosed with a 5.7 cm renal carcinoma 4 months before and followed up with no therapy, presented with a 3-day history of macrohematuria. Abdominal CT revealed an enlarged right renal tumor, tumoral hemorrhage, and a right retroperitoneal hematoma. Therefore, spontaneous rupture of the renal carcinoma was diagnosed. As his general condition was not serious, he rejected aggressive treatments such as nephrectomy. Instead, he chose treatment with an antineoplastic drug, UFT, which was started orally at a dose of 200mg/day. Under hospitalization, his clinical course was uneventful, and he was discharged 14 days later. Follow-up CT films showed that the size of the tumor gradually decreased. Sixteen months after UFT administration, a CT displayed a right renal tumor with an 86% decrease in size compared with the tumor size when first diagnosed."
27805528,Splenic Peliosis Resulting in Spontaneous Splenic Rupture in a Concomitant Hepatic and Renal Allograft Recipient.,"Splenic peliosis is an exceedingly rare complication following liver and kidney transplant, with few previously reported cases. A 24-year-old man with chronic renal and hepatic failure due to primary oxalosis underwent concomitant renal and hepatic transplant. On the eighth day of successful transplant, he showed signs and symptoms of hypovolemia with suspicion of intra-abdominal bleeding. Diagnostic laparotomy was performed, yielding splenic rupture, and a splenectomy was performed. Macroscopically, the spleen was ruptured, and the cut surface displayed multiple parenchymal blood-filled cysts. Microscopically, the splenic microarchitecture was distorted by numerous irregular hemorrhagic lacunes partially lined by sinusoidal endothelium. Splenic peliosis was diagnosed. The patient recovered with splenectomy. Peliosis is a condition characterized by multiple bloodfilled cavities in parenchymatous organs, and it most frequently affects the liver. It is thought to be related to many conditions, including hematologic malignancies, acquired immuno deficiency syndrome, chronic alcoholism, use of oral contraceptives, and posttransplant immunodeficiency state. However, peliosis of the spleen, compared with the liver, is relatively rare, and it may cause spontaneous splenic rupture. Although rare, splenic peliosis and secondary splenic rupture is a significant posttransplant complications leading to unexplained hypovolemia."
24943075,[Clinical manifestations of 16 patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma -stroke mimic and pitfalls for diagnosis].,"Clinical manifestations of 16 patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma were presented. We examined the point similar to that of stroke. During the initial visit of our hospital, the patients showed the hemiplegia in 10 cases (62.5%), Horner syndrome in 4 cases (25%), the painless onset in 1 case (6.3%). And one case showed the impairment of consciousness due to vagal reflex in severe pain onset, which was similar to those of subarachnoid hemorrhage. MRI images are useful to confirm the diagnosis. The frequent site of hematoma was the lower cervical spinal cord. The oval shaped hematomas shifted to the left or right in spinal canals, compressed spinal cords in axial image, which was a cause of hemiplegia. Many cases developed during active periods, and the hemorrhage might be relevant to oral antithrombotic agent, C hepatitis, and chronic renal failure. Rapidly progressive cases were indications for emergency surgery, but conservative therapy is also possible and was better prognosis."
24626009,Giant renal artery pseudoaneurysm caused by rupture of renal angiomyolipoma following pregnancy: endovascular treatment and review of the literature.,"Renal angiomyolipoma is a hamartomatous, benign tumor composed of blood vessels, fatty tissue and smooth muscle cells, and is often detected incidentally. It can also be associated with the tuberous-sclerosis complex (TSC). Pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives are known to be associated with an increased risk of tumoral rupture and bleeding. Herein, we report a unique case of renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC who presented with hypovolemic shock as a result of spontaneous rupture of a giant renal pseudoaneurysm, immediately after pregnancy. Emergency endovascular treatment was successful with sparing of most of the affected kidney as demonstrated by follow-up computed tomography imaging."
22669112,Gingival bleeding and jaw bone necrosis in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving sunitinib: report of 2 cases with clinical implications.,"There is emerging evidence that oral mucositis/stomatitis is a common adverse effect of sunitininb antiangiogenic therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). In addition, a case of sunitinib-related jaw osteonecrosis was recently described. We report on 2 patients with mRCC treated with sunitinib. The first patient, a 19-year-old woman, treated with cisplatin and sunitinib, presented with oral pain, malodor, spontaneous and continuous gingival bleeding, and painful necrotic ulcerations clinically resembling necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Suntinib-related stomatitis and bleeding were considered cumulative to NUG symptoms. The second patient, a 64-year-old woman, treated with sunitinib only, complained of mandibular pain. Sunitinib-related jaw osteonecrosis was diagnosed. Gingival bleeding and soft tissue necrosis, as well as jaw osteonecrosis may develop as adverse events of sunitinib use. Antiangiogenic therapies are increasingly used in the treatment of cancers. The presented cases are aimed to alert health care professionals on adverse oral events."
21735396,Ibuprofen for the prevention of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Indomethacin has been the standard treatment to close a PDA but is associated with renal, gastrointestinal and cerebral side-effects. Ibuprofen has less effect on blood flow velocity to important organs.
To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic ibuprofen compared to placebo/no intervention in the prevention of PDA in preterm infants.
Randomized controlled trials of prophylactic ibuprofen were identified by searching in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and trials registries in December 2010.
Randomized or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.
Outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three, need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), renal, pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed and treatment estimates are reported as typical weighted mean difference, relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or number needed to treat to harm (NNH) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).
In this update, seven studies (n = 931) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention are included. Ibuprofen decreased the incidence of PDA on day three [typical RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.46); typical RD -0.27 (95% CI -0.32 to -0.21); NNT 4 (95% CI 3 to 5)], decreased the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and decreased the need for surgical ligation. Results from two studies administering oral ibuprofen had similar results, but showed an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNH 4, 95% CI 2 to 17). In the control group the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day three. Ibuprofen negatively affects renal function. No significant differences in mortality, IVH, chronic lung disease were found.
Prophylactic use of ibuprofen decreased the incidence of PDA, decreased the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and decreased the need for surgical closure. In the control group, the PDA closed spontaneously by day three in 58% of the neonates. Prophylactic treatment exposes many infants to a drug that has concerning renal and gastrointestinal side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits and is not recommended. Until long-term follow-up results are published from the trials included in this updated review, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended."
16444440,Spontaneous renal subcapsular hematoma in an anticoagulated patient.,"This is a case report of spontaneous subcapsular renal hematoma in an anticoagulated patient who was without excessive hypocoagulability and who was hemodynamically stable. Active bleeding was ruled out and a conservative treatment of discontinuing anticoagulant therapy was chosen. The patient was observed expectantly with serial abdominal computed tomography and abdominal ultrasound during her stay in the hospital. When diminution of the hematoma was detected, oral anticoagulation was resumed."
15731548,Spontaneous multiple arterial dissections presenting with renal infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage in a patient under treatment for infertility.,"A 36-year-old woman developed multiple spontaneous arterial dissections in both renal arteries, the carotid artery, superior mesenteric artery, and vertebral artery, but not the aorta, and she suffered a renal infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage within a short period of time. She had been undergoing frequent injections of human chorionic gonadotropin and human menopausal gonadotropin, together with oral estrogen therapy, during a 5-year infertility treatment regimen. As she had no other history of any disorder affecting the arterial walls, this therapy is suspected to have caused the multiple arterial deformities. Although cases of isolated arterial dissection are occasionally reported, it is rare for multiple dissections and serious symptoms to occur simultaneously."
14513542,[Retroperitoneal bleeding caused by renal angiomyolipoma].,"An 81-year-old woman presented with left-flank pain, anaemia and a fast irregular pulse while using oral anticoagulation. Diagnostic investigation revealed retroperitoneal bleeding caused by a medium-sized renal angiomyolipoma. Angiomyolipoma was also found in the contralateral kidney. No tuberous sclerosis was ascertained. Bleeding stopped after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Renal angiomyolipoma is an uncommon benign tumour which is frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis. Spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding is a potentially life-threatening complication. This type of tumour is usually found incidentally on radiological examination."
12814684,Spontaneous rupture of non-tumoral kidneys in patients with end stage renal failure: risks and management.,"To determine the risks and treatment modalities of spontaneous subcapsular or perinephric bleeding in end stage renal patients.
8 patients with end stage renal failure developed a spontaneous hemorrhage of one of their native kidneys and were referred to our institution. They were all men. Six of them presented an acquired renal cystic disease. Symptoms included sudden abdominal pain in 7 patients, vomiting in 2 and hematuria in 1. Symptoms were always associated with a hemoglobin decrease. Four patients were receiving oral anticoagulants for various reasons and one had thrombopenia. Bleeding was confirmed by computerized tomography and nephrectomy undertaken in all cases.
3 patients died in the immediate post-operative period. Histologic findings confirmed bleeding and did not find any other abnormality than those related to renal insufficiency (cysts and atrophy).
Renal rupture should be considered in case of unexplained distress or sudden fall of the hemoglobin especially when patients are on anticoagulants. Surgery is our preferred treatment because of the frequency of unrevealed tumours and the potential mortality of massive hematomas."
12555463,[Multiple cholesterol emboli syndrome: beneficial effects of early heparin therapy. A case report].,"The multiple cholesterol emboli syndrome (MCES) is a rare, multi-organ disease than can occur spontaneously or after arterial or cardiac catheterization, arteriography, angioplasty, cardiovascular surgery, oral or intravenous anticoagulation, systemic fibrinolysis and cardiorespiratory resuscitation, predominantly in male subjects with disseminated atherosclerosis over the age of 60 years. Clinical signs of MCES vary considerably depending on the organs involved, but the signs most frequently encountered are renal failure, skin lesions (livedo reticularis, purple toc, ulcers, etc) and transient eosinophilia. Optimal treatment of this syndrome is controversial and is often symptomatic. However, the most effective measure remains prevention based on identification of high-risk patients, treatment with platelet antiaggregants and careful handling of catheters. This syndrome has a serious prognosis in the majority of cases. In this article, the authors describe a case of MCES. After thoracic aortography, this 73-years-old patient presented typical clinical sign of MCES (angina, cerebrovascular accident, bilateral blindness, transient renal failure and splenic infarction). The clinical course was favourable in response to heparin therapy and splenectomy and caudal pancreatectomy. Histology confirmed the presence of cholesterol emboli in the lumen of splenic arterioles. Except in the case of severe bleeding diathesis, the authors recommend early heparin therapy for MCES caused by catheterization, angioplasty or cardiovascular surgery. However, complementary studies must be performed to more clearly define the effects of heparin on MCES."
11815369,"Cardiovascular actions of a novel NO-independent guanylyl cyclase stimulator, BAY 41-8543: in vivo studies.","BAY 41-8543 is a novel non-NO-based stimulator of sGC. This study investigates the acute effects of BAY 41-8543 on haemodynamics in anaesthetized rats and dogs, its long-term effects in conscious hypertension rat models and its antiplatelet effects. In anaesthetized dogs, intravenous injections of BAY 41-8543 (3 - 100 microg kg(-1)) caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and cardiac oxygen consumption as well as an increase in coronary blood flow and heart rate. In anaesthetized normotensive rats, BAY 41-8543 produced a dose-dependent and long-lasting blood pressure lowering effect after intravenous (3 - 300 microg kg(-1)) and oral (0.1 - 1 mg kg(-1)) administration. A dose-dependent and long-lasting decrease in blood pressure was also observed in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with a threshold dose of 0.1 mg kg(-1) p.o. After 3 mg kg(-1) the antihypertensive effect lasted for nearly 24 h. After multiple dosages, BAY 41-8543 did not develop tachyphylaxis in SHR. BAY 41-8543 prolonged the rat tail bleeding time and reduced thrombosis in the FeCl(3) thrombosis model after oral administration. In a low NO, high renin rat model of hypertension, BAY 41-8543 prevented the increase in blood pressure evoked by L-NAME and reveals a kidney protective effect. In this model, the overall beneficial effects of BAY 41-8543 manifested as both antiplatelet effect and vasodilatation were reflected in a significant reduction in mortality. The pharmacological profile of BAY 41-8543 suggests therefore that this compound has the potential to be an important research tool for in vivo investigations in the sGC/cGMP field and it also has the potential of being a unique clinical utility for treatment of cardiovascular diseases."
9360284,Management of ascites in the patient with portal hypertension with emphasis on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"The reintroduction of paracentesis has modified the way in which patients with ascites are treated. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt can be an alternative treatment for patients with refractory ascites and for those patients with hepatorenal syndrome, although more studies are needed to clarify its usefulness and safety. The use of more potent and less nephrotoxic antibiotics together with an earlier diagnosis have improved the outcome of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Oral antibiotics can be used in patients with SBP and good clinical conditions with an efficacy similar to that obtained with intravenous antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics in SBP should be restricted to cirrhotic patients at high risk, including bleeding cirrhotic patients, those with a past history of SBP, and those with low protein content in ascitic fluid. This chapter describes the management of ascites in patients with portal hypertension."
9408968,Bacterial infections in liver disease.,"Most bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients are hospital-acquired. Urinary tract infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), respiratory tract infections, and bacteremia are the most frequent bacterial infectious complications seen in cirrhotic patients. SBP is the most characteristic infectious complication of cirrhotic patients, and it is defined as the infection of a previously sterile ascitic fluid, with no apparent intra-abdominal source of infection. The incidence of SBP in cirrhotic patients admitted to hospital with ascites has been estimated to range between 7 and 23%. The diagnosis is established on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms and/or a polymorphonuclear cell count in ascitic fluid higher than 250/mm3. This diagnosis is confirmed by a positive culture in approximately 70% of the cases. The remaining 30% are considered culture-negative SBP but are empirically treated with antibiotics because severe peritonitis and death may follow if these patients are not treated. Early diagnosis, the routine use of diagnostic paracentesis in patients admitted to hospital with ascites, and, especially, the use of adequate antibiotics are very important tools in the treatment of SBP. Third-generation cephalosporins are the first-choice antibiotic treatment in SBP, although selected patients with SBP, those with normal renal function and without hepatic encephalopathy, shock, or gastrointestinal bleeding, may be treated with oral quinolones. Selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin is safe and useful in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of SBP, although the incidence of quinolone-resistant organisms is increasing and this may be a problem in the future."
9280905,[Management of acute renal failure in hospital practice].,"The incidence of ARF in pediatric population varies according to the definition of the syndrome. If the diagnosis is based on a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), possibly accompanied by a decrease of urinary output and the sudden change of renal function indexes, then the number of patients which can be considered affected by ARF in hospital practice is high, as it comprises all the cases with functional impairment of renal function. The availability of tables with normal values of serum creatinine for different gender and age and the knowledge of the minimal urine output compatible with the normality allows a precise diagnosis of ARF. The differential diagnosis of ARF must take into account prerenal, renal and postrenal causes. Prerenal and renal ARF may be sometimes difficult to differentiate. Indexes such as sodium fractional excretion, utilizing urinary to plasma ratios of sodium and creatinine, can be helpful: values less than 1 indicate prerenal ARF, more than 2 renal ARF. The management of ARF is dependent on the causes of ARF. Prerenal ARF is normally treated by measures of volume expansion and/or removal of the underlying cause. Renal ARF requires an accurate control of water and electrolyte balance and of nutritional status and the prevention or treatment of numerous complications, which may worsen the course of the syndrome. Indications to dialysis must be evaluated every day and an assessment of nutritional status performed. All the factors which may cause hypercatabolism, such as infections, hemorrhage, low calorie intake, must be recognized and treated. This approach allows a better control of serum urea, potassium, phosphate and acidosis. Nutrition must be implemented and an adequate protein and calorie intake must be obtained, through spontaneous oral route and, whenever required, enteral and parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, patients with mild-degree, mostly of prerenal origin, ARF represent a common finding in hospital practice. Identification and prompt treatment of the underlying cause is the best prevention of acute tubular necrosis. Patients with ARF of renal origin require, in particular, daily nutritional assessment and dietary treatment to delay the onset of dialysis."
6347951,[Primary adenoma of the liver with spontaneous rupture following long-term intake of gestagens. Case report].,"A case report of a 26-year old woman on chronic hemodialysis for pyelonephritis who took 10 mg of norethisterone acetate daily for suppression of menstruation. 1 week before admission colic-like pains appeared in right upper abdominal quadrant which were relieved by spasmolytics. Laboratory parameters (except those related to renal insufficiency), physical examination, x-rays of chest, stomach and biliary tract showed no abnormalities. Sonography revealed various round space-occupying lesions in the lower liver lobe. Before further studies could be initiated and following a hemodialysis session patient died of an intrahepatic hemorrhage confirmed by ultra-sonic and CAT-scan. Autopsy showed a large hematoma with more than 700 ml coagulated blood which caused rupture of the right liver lobe. Round adenomas were found in both lobes. The relationship between oral contraceptives and primary liver adenomas in young women without previous liver disease has been reported in the literature since 1973. 200 cases were found in the literature since 1977. Although mostly estrogens are blamed for liver adenomas, in this case it was a pure progestogen preparation. In another study of women with primary liver adenomas only 1 in 100 women used a pure progestin contraceptive. A relationship between androgens or anabolic steroids has been found in a number of case reports in the literature. It can be assumed that both combination preparations with estrogen components, and pure progestin preparations play a similar role in the pathogenesis of benign liver tumors."

Strategies of prevention may consist of platelet aggregation inhibitors and/or cytoreductive agents depending on the underlying disease and the individual risk. Clinical evidence for management of acute venous thromboembolic events in MPN patients is limited. Modality and duration of therapeutic anticoagulation after venous thrombosis has to be evaluated critically with special regard to the increased risk for spontaneous bleeding events associated with the underlying diseases. Both for therapy of the acute event and for secondary prophylaxis, low-molecular-weight heparins should preferentially be used. A prolongation of the therapeutic anticoagulation beyond the usual 3 to 6 months can only be recommended in high-risk settings and after careful evaluation of potential risks and benefits for the individual patient. New direct oral anticoagulants (NOAC) should not preferentially be used due to lack of clinical experience in patients with MPN and potential drug interactions (e.g. with JAK inhibitors). Consequent treatment of the underlying myeloproliferative disease and periodical evaluation of the response to therapy is crucial for optimal secondary prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in those patients."
36522676,Severe alveolar bone resorption in Felty syndrome: a case report.,"Felty syndrome is defined by three conditions: neutropenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and splenomegaly. Neutropenia associated with pancytopenia may further affect the dental condition of a patient. Periodontal treatment and surgery in patients with Felty syndrome necessitates cooperation with a hematologist. Here we present a case of a patient with Felty syndrome who was initially referred to the oral surgery hospital attached to the School of Dentistry for extensive periodontitis. She was effectively treated in collaboration with the hematology department.
A 55-year-old Asian woman visited our department with concerns of worsening tooth mobility, discomfort, and spontaneous gingival bleeding. Initial periodontal examination revealed generalized severe periodontitis (Stage IV Grade C) resulting from leukopenia/neutropenia and poor oral hygiene. A thorough treatment strategy involving comprehensive dental procedures, such as multiple extractions and extensive prosthetic treatment, was implemented. Following the diagnosis of Felty syndrome, the patient was started on treatment with oral prednisolone 40 mg/day, which effectively controlled the disease. Furthermore, there was no recurrence of severe periodontitis after the periodontal treatment.
Dentists and physicians should be aware that immunocompromised individuals with pancytopenia and poor oral hygiene are at risk of developing extensive periodontitis. If their susceptibility to infection and pancytopenia-related bleeding can be managed, such patients can still receive comprehensive dental treatment, including teeth extractions and periodontal therapy. Cooperation among the dentist, hematologist, and patient is necessary to improve treatment outcomes and the patient's quality of life."
36096718,Subacute stent thrombosis with spontaneously resolved secondary thrombi in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a case report.,"Stent thrombosis (ST) is a serious complication; however, a method to prevent ST in patients with thrombophilic diseases has not been established.
We report a case of subacute ST in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who was receiving continuous heparin treatment in addition to the usual dual antiplatelet therapy for contrast defects at the proximal site of the occluded right coronary artery and the proximal site of the left circumflex artery. Despite the resolution of thrombi in secondary lesions, subacute ST occurred. After percutaneous coronary intervention for ST, triple therapy, including oral anticoagulation for PNH-related thrombosis, was initiated. The patient subsequently underwent craniotomy hematoma removal for hemorrhagic cerebral infarction.
Reported cases of ST in patients with PNH are very few, and this case adds evidence with respect to antithrombotic therapy in patients with thrombotic tendencies. Both thrombosis and bleeding should be considered when administering antithrombotic therapy to patients with thrombotic diseases. If there are specific treatments for thrombophilic diseases, they should be initiated early."

Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy findings could not confirm the source of hemorrhage. Capsule endoscopy (CE) of the small intestine showed an active exudative hemorrhagic site near the ileum, although a definitive diagnosis was difficult. In a double balloon enteroscopy examination, it was difficult to observe the entire small intestine due to adhesions and the responsible lesion could not be confirmed, even when ink spots were applied to the deepest observation points through the mouth and anus. Hemostasis spontaneously occurred, and then anemia occurred again approximately 1 month later and a second CE examination was performed including passage of an ink stick through the oral side, which revealed an exudative elevated polyp with erosion and a white moss appearance in the ileum. Partial ileal resection was performed and pyogenic granuloma of the small intestine was the diagnosis. We report here a case of pyogenic granuloma of the small intestine associated with Cowden's disease."

The patient had experienced chronic severe refractory gastrointestinal bleeding for years. She had an intermittent spontaneous epistaxis, telangiectasias in the oral cavity (tongue), and hepatic arteriovenous malformations and gastrointestinal telangiectasia. She underwent a segmental resection of a segment of the ileum and cecum (about 77 cm). After surgery, the patient experienced no more drops in hemoglobin count or symptoms of anemia and melena. She is living a normal life.
The present case report is a surgical case of undiagnosed HHT with chronic refractory gastrointestinal bleeding. Surgical treatment is rarely required for gastrointestinal bleeding unless nonsurgical methods such as endoscopy/colonoscopy and angiography have failed."
32231808,Gingival Bleeding in a Child with Fanconi Anemia: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and higher susceptibility to malignancies, especially to head and neck carcinomas. Only few reports about the oral manifestations of FA are available. The main reported oral conditions associated with FA are microdontia and advanced periodontitis. The aim of this paper was to report a case of a 10-year-old patient with FA presenting severe spontaneous gingival bleeding, as well as to discuss the role of the dentist in the management and treatment of this condition."
31932125,Pain in the hip: Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage in an elderly patient on apixaban.,"As many as 5% of patients using oral anticoagulants suffer from a major bleeding event annually. Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rare but serious complication, with a mortality rate as high as 20%. Oral anticoagulants were responsible for 2.83 million office visits per quarter in 2014 and use is increasing, therefore, rapid recognition of life threatening complications is critical. We present a case of an 86-year-old female taking apixaban for atrial fibrillation who presented with right hip pain upon standing. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and anemia. A CT scan of the right hip revealed a moderately sized retroperitoneal hematoma. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, treated with supportive care, and was discharged two days later without any invasive intervention needed. Due to vague presentations, spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhages can be misdiagnosed as a number of abdominal or pelvic processes. While our patient presented with hip pain, other presentations include abdominal masses, back pain, or hypotension. Some patients may progress to hemodynamic instability, femoral neuropathy, or abdominal compartment syndrome requiring rapid intervention to prevent further morbidity. In patients with vague abdominal or pelvic complaints who have risk factors such as advanced age and the use of anticoagulation therapy, spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage should be considered to allow for early diagnosis before severe complications arise."
30140582,Traumatic and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in atrial fibrillation patients on warfarin.,"Intracranial hemorrhage is the most devastating complication in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving oral anticoagulation (OAC). It can be either spontaneous or caused by head trauma. We sought to address the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of traumatic and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages in AF patients on OAC.
Multicenter FibStroke registry of 5,629 patients identified 592 intracranial hemorrhages during warfarin treatment between 2003 and 2012.
A large proportion (40%) of intracranial hemorrhages were traumatic. Of these, 64% were subdural hemorrhages (SDHs) and 20% intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs). With respect to the spontaneous hemorrhages, 25% were SDHs and 67% ICHs. Patients with traumatic hemorrhage were older (81 vs 78 years, 
A significant proportion of intracranial hemorrhages in anticoagulated AF patients were traumatic. Traumatic hemorrhages were predominantly SDHs and less often fatal when compared to spontaneous hemorrhages, which were mainly ICHs. Admission INR values as well as CHA

29602889,Adult scurvy associated with psychiatric disorders and breast feeding.,"Scurvy is a nutritional disease caused by ascorbic acid deficiency and is potentially fatal. It was originally described in the 18th century by James Lind and associated with long sea voyages and insufficient citrus consumption. Its prevalence has declined markedly over the years but has still been described sporadically in certain countries. A 22-year-old woman with an anxiety disorder and anorexia nervosa, recent pregnancy and ongoing breast feeding, presented with a 10-day history of spontaneous haematomas in the lower limbs, gingivorrhagia and fatigue. The examination was remarkable for signs of minor bleeding without haemodynamic compromise, gonalgia and pale skin. Work-up studies revealed the presence of anaemia. Direct anamnesis identified a diet based solely of tea and carbohydrates due to distorted body image. With the working diagnosis of scurvy, nutritional support and oral vitamin C supplementation was initiated. Her symptoms and anaemia resolved in 30 days and the diagnosis was confirmed biochemically."
26864533,Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma in a patient under anticoagulant agents presenting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"We present the case of a 44-year-old woman with past history of repeated miscarriage and Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to primary myelofibrosis. Because of this she was under treatment with oral anticoagulant agents. The patient was admitted in hospital as she presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), asthenia and progressive anemia. In an initial upper endoscopy an extrinsic duodenal compression associated with an ulcer on the posterior face of the first portion of duodenum and upper duodenal knee was observed. In the following days a huge spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma due to anticoagulation was diagnosed by computed tomography. This was treated with a percutaneous drainage and withdrawal of the antithrombotic drugs. The evolution of the patient was initially satisfactory but she suffered subclavian and jugular vein thrombosis, and reintroduction of anticoagulant agents at the lowest therapeutic doses was required."
26545367,The Role of FEIBA in Reversing Novel Oral Anticoagulants in Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Activated prothrombin complex concentrates factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA) has been recommended for reversing novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in the context of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), though few clinical studies report its use.
A prospective study of patients with spontaneous ICH was conducted from May 2013 to May 2015. Hospital complications including hemorrhage (gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia requiring transfusion, and surgical site bleeding) and thrombosis (pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction) were recorded. All ICH patients underwent baseline head CT and a follow-up stability scan in 6 h. NOAC taken within 48 h of presentation was reversed with FEIBA (50 u/kg) per protocol. Three-month outcomes were assessed using the modified rankin score (mRS).
Of 127 ICH patients enrolled, 6 (5 %) had NOAC-related ICH including: oral factor XA inhibitor N = 5 (4 %; N = 4 rivaroxaban, N = 1 apixaban] and direct thrombin inhibitor N = 1 (0.8 %; dabigatran). The indication for NOAC was atrial fibrillation in all patients and the median CHADS2-VASC score was 4 (range 2-5). The median admission NIHSS was 2 (range 0-14) and the median ICH volume was 8 mL (range 1-20). Five patients (3 rivaroxaban, 1 apixaban, 1 dabigatran) presented within 48 h and received FEIBA within a median of 13 h (range 10-29 h) from their last NOAC dose and 8 h (range 4.5-20) from the time last known well. None of the patients had ICH expansion, hemorrhagic, or thrombotic complications. Three-month median mRS was 1 (range 0-6).
In this small case series, reversal of NOAC with FEIBA was not associated with ICH expansion or any thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications."
24124376,Postmarketing safety experience with edoxaban in Japan for thromboprophylaxis following major orthopedic surgery.,"Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily, selective, direct factor Xa inhibitor approved in Japan for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery. Currently, edoxaban is in Phase III clinical development for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and prevention of recurrences of venous thromboembolism. This report describes the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) spontaneously reported during early postmarketing phase vigilance from the time of its commercial launch in Japan.
All spontaneously reported ADRs following edoxaban use received by Daiichi Sankyo during early postmarketing phase vigilance from July 19, 2011, to January 18, 2012, were entered into the safety database and included in this review. Approximately 20,000 patients were estimated to have been treated with edoxaban.
The mean age of patients was 74.2 years, their mean weight was 59.4 kg, and approximately 70% were female. A total of 67 ADRs were reported in 56 patients, of which the majority included bleeding events (51 ADRs in 42 patients). Of these, 15 ADRs (in 14 patients) were serious, including cerebral hemorrhage (n = 1), gastric hemorrhage (n = 2; gastric hemorrhage [n = 1] and gastric ulcer hemorrhage [n = 1]), and surgical-site hemorrhage (n = 12; hemorrhage [n = 6], subcutaneous hemorrhage [n = 3], wound hemorrhage [n = 2], and wound hematoma [n = 1]). Most ADRs occurred within the first week of treatment and there were no fatalities. Nonserious ADRs associated with bleeding that occurred in >1 patient included subcutaneous hemorrhage (n = 9), wound hemorrhage (n = 5), postprocedural hematoma (n = 4), anemia (n = 4), and hemarthrosis (n = 3). Other nonserious ADRs not associated with bleeding and occurring in >1 patient included abnormal hepatic function (n = 4) and diarrhea (n = 2).
Safety data from the first 6 months of postmarketing experience with edoxaban did not identify any unforeseen safety signals, consistent with the known safety profile of edoxaban."
24083041,Pemphigoid gestationis after spontaneous expulsion of a massive complete hydatidiform mole.,"Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare, perinatal, autoimmune, and blistering dermatosis. Only few cases of PG involving hydatidiform moles have been reported. Complete hydatidiform moles are usually evacuated by dilatation and curettage. We report a patient with a massive complete hydatidiform mole that underwent spontaneous expulsion; she subsequently developed PG. A 19-year-old unmarried nulligravid woman was referred to our hospital following excessive vaginal bleeding after an uncertain amenorrheal period. The patient presented with preshock vital signs, severe anemia, and a positive urine pregnancy test. Imaging examinations revealed a massive intrauterine mass (19 × 15 × 10 cm), suggesting a complete hydatidiform mole. She was hospitalized and treated with blood transfusion. Sixteen hours after hospitalization, the massive molar mass underwent spontaneous expulsion and bleeding ceased. Three days after the expulsion, she developed pruritic skin lesions including papules, erythemas, and bullae, which spread over her entire body. Skin biopsy revealed PG and subepidermal blister formation and linear complement C3 deposition along the basement membrane zone, and the serum anti-BP180 antibody level was found to be high on measurement. She was effectively treated with 50 mg/day of oral prednisolone. Her skin lesions disappeared, leaving pigmentation."
23379198,[Interstitial laser coagulation in Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion sequence].,"Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion (TRAP) sequence complicates about 1% of all monochorionic twin pregnancies and about 1 to 35000 of all pregnancies. It involves an acardiac twin whose structural defects are incompatible with life, and an otherwise normal ""pump"" co-twin. As the blood flow in the acardiac twin is reversed, it keeps on growing owing to the oxygenated blood from the co-twin. Here we report a case of monochorionic, diamniotic twin pregnancy after ICS/-ET complicated with TRAP sequence, diagnosed at 11 weeks of pregnancy The unusual finding in this case was the residual heart in the so called acardiac twin. Gradually the normal twin developed signs of hemodynamic compromise. Reversed a-wave in ductus venosus was observed. The acardiac twin showed subcutaneous oedema. On 24 November 2011 a successful interstitial ultrasound-guided laser coagulation was performed at 16 weeks of gestation. 17G needle and 0.6 mm laser fibre were used. The needle was introduced into the pelvic region of the acardiac twin through the abdominal wall. A series of laser bursts lasting 5-10 seconds were fired, until cessation of blood flow in the pelvic vessels and umbilical cord of the acardiac twin was confirmed using colour Doppler. The course of the intervention was uneventful. Routine steroid therapy was administered at 27 weeks of gestation. At 32 weeks the patient was hospitalized and oral antibiotics were administered due to premature rupture of the membranes and suspicion of intrauterine growth retardation of the pump twin. The patient delivered spontaneously at completed 33 weeks of pregnancy (weight 1805g, Apgar 10). After the delivery a stage 2 intraventricular hemorrhage and jaundice were observed in the neonate. Phototherapy was administered and the mother and the child were eventually discharged from the hospital, both in good general condition. Since then, two more successful interstitial laser coagulations in TRAP sequence were performed in our institution. The essence of the treatment of TRAP sequence is cessation of the blood flow from the pump to the acardiac twin. Fetoscopic cord ligature or coagulation, and laser or radiofreqency ablations of the acardiac twin vessels, are the possible methods of intervention. The interstitial laser coagulation of the acardiac twin is less invasive than fetoscopic umbilical cord coagulation, as the outer diameter of the 17G needle is much smaller. A meticulous comparison of these methods would require a randomised study but at 16 weeks of MCDA twin pregnancy interstitial laser coagulation seems to be the method of choice. The outcome of the procedure and possible treatment options in case of TRAP together with the review of literature, are presented in the article."
15259974,Naso-orbicular tissue necrosis by Streptococcus parasanguis in a patient with Fanconi anemia: clinical and laboratory aspects.,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by pancytopenia and progressive hypoplasia of the bone marrow. A 23-year-old woman with FA showed severe pancytopenia and developed an abscess on the infraorbicular region on the right side of the face that progressed to phlegmon and caused tissue necrosis of the nostrils, nasal septum, nasal fossa, and posterior orbital region. Laboratory examination showed Streptococcus parasanguis as the etiologic agent of the phlegmon. Supportive treatment was recommended due to donor incompatibility for bone marrow transplant. The intraoral examination showed spontaneous gingival bleeding, edema of the interdental papillae, hematomas on the superior and inferior lips, bacterial and fungal infections, and adequate oral hygiene. The patient was treated with the administration of an antibiotic (imipenem), an antifungal (amphotericin B), and mouth washing with antiseptic solutions. Periodontal prophylaxis and orientation to and control of oral hygiene and diet were also used during the remission period. For functional and esthetic rehabilitation of the alar regions and nasal dorsum, an acrylic resin nasal prosthesis was made, supported by a spectacle frame."

For this reason an unusual cause of bleeding can pass unnoticed, and a late diagnosis is an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In this case report we describe the rupture of am hepatic adenoma as cause of abdominal hemorrhage in adolescent pregnant during the labor. The patient didn't have an antecedent of oral contraceptives use; but a has a history of previous spontaneous abortion."
11324413,Signs of medullar aplasia in the oral cavity: report of case.,"Medullar aplasia is a hematological disease characterized by medullar dysfunction that results in a marked decrease of various hematological cellular elements. This produces anemia, infections of different etiologies and also, spontaneous or provoked hemorrhagic syndromes of varying importance. A case of medullar aplasia affecting a child, diagnosed after a tooth extraction is reported, and accompanied by its pathological characteristics. In addition, an easy reading E.L.I.S.A/ test for diagnosing herpes virus type 1 or 2 is presented."
9567616,[A peculiar form of anemia in patients operated on for cancer of the oral cavity].,"The authors related about a peculiar form of anemia found in some patients operated on oral cancer; these patients had an almost normal hematic situation before their operation. 63 patients, operated in the course of a year for oral cancer, have been studied by the authors; they have found in 14 cases (22.2%) a light anemia which regressed after a self blood transfusion, during the first week after the operation; in other 8 cases (12.7%) the anemia, which was more serious, persisted beyond the 7th day after the operation. Those 8 patients, suffering from more serious and persistent anemia, were treated from 7th to 21st day after the operation with iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid without any improvement. The hematic situation improved about 10 days after the end of treatment, probably as a result of spontaneous renewal of medullar haemopoietic activity. This anemia, is characterized by normochromia, normocytosis, reduced response of reticulocytes, sideropenia and hyperferritinaemia. The authors think that the pathogenesis of anemia after operation in neoplastic patients is caused by medullary insufficiency existing before the operation, connected with reduced erythropoietin production and emphasized by an operation that sometimes cause bleeding. Consequently the authors hypothesis the use of erythropoietin in the therapy of most severe anemia in neoplastic operated patients."
1362187,The underrated benefits of oral contraception: consequences of pregnancy and induced abortion in teenagers.,"If complications occur within a pregnancy planned and brought to term, they often can be dealt with and accepted. They are even more traumatic when they occur in an unwanted pregnancy that could have been prevented through contraception. Teenagers, because of their physical and psychological immaturity and also because of their social environment, seem to suffer with undue frequency from the complications of induced abortion. Its result, for the teenager, is a handicapped future in comparison to other women. Hence, access to contraception is important for all women, and especially for teenagers, in order to avoid such prejudicial situations. It is important, then, to prescribe oral contraception for its efficacy and its short- and long-term innocuousness. Because of her immaturity, the pregnant teenager is at risk: of spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia, anemia, hemorrhage, and prematurity. She is also at risk because of the social difficulties she will be facing. This is particularly true in families from developing countries. From birth, the child is also at risk: of low birth weight for the term, mortality in the first year of life, and all risks linked to abandonment, or education by a third party. In a proportion of 13 to 30% in western countries and in a proportion of 3% in East Asia or in Northwest Africa (Maghreb), induced abortions are a reflection of the following: early sexual activity without contraception even if fertility is still low in very young teenagers, absence of social protection or social independence, refusal of forced marriage, and presence or absence of liberal legislation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Adolescent pregnancy rates are higher among US teenagers than among Swedish teenagers, even though there is a higher proportion of teenage virgins in the US. A leading reason for this discrepancy is that contraceptive use among sexually active US teenagers, especially those who have recently become sexually active, is quite low. Even teenagers using contraceptives experience unwanted pregnancy due to incorrect or inconsistent use of a method, especially barrier methods. Thus, access to abortion services and postcoital contraception are needed. The reasons teenagers often delay abortion are denial of pregnancy, irregular menses and inexperience about signs of pregnancy, fear of telling parents, and not knowing where to seek help. In most countries, adolescents comprise a considerable percentage of abortion patients. They are also at high risk of suffering some abortion complications, one reason being they tend to undergo abortion at later gestational ages than older women. For example, 2nd trimester abortions pose a risk 3-10 times greater than 1st trimester abortions. Teenagers under 17 years old and undergoing suction curettage are at greater risk of cervical injury than older women. On the other hand, teenagers do not face higher risk of other abortion complications than do older women. Adolescents undergoing abortions in developing countries face greater risk of complications, especially mortality, due to certain cultural or sanitary conditions. An unwanted pregnancy places teenagers at considerable risk, e.g., delivering a low birth weight child at high risk of mortality. These findings indicate the need for sexually active teenagers to have accurate information on reproduction and contraception and access to family planning services at an early age. Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the most effective contraceptive for adolescents and provide other benefits as well. Physicians need to promote OC use and communicate OCs' noncontraceptive benefits to teenagers because they often are unable to perceive them. Physicians also need to stress that OCs do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS."
3059486,"[Unusual features in Glanzmann thrombasthenia; proliferation of B-lymphocytes, lead poisoning].","Four case histories are reported: 1. A 37-year-old woman suffering from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia has been regularly seen since 1955. Characteristically (and in contrast to the first description by Glanzmann!) persistently prolonged bleeding times were noted. Clot retraction is severely diminished and the platelets fail to aggregate upon various stimuli. (Platelet agglutination upon addition of ristocetin to platelet rich plasma is normal.) The diagnosis of thrombasthenia was confirmed by demonstration of a deficiency of the membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. In recent years the patient has become refractory to platelet transfusion therapy, a response shown to be due to antibodies against GPIIb/IIIa in the plasma. Spontaneous bleeding tendency has appeared to improve over the years. 2. Two patients with proliferation of B-lymphocytes are presented. a) Splenomegaly and an increase of B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were detected in a 45-year-old asymptomatic man. DNA analysis suggested that polyclonal proliferation of B-lymphocytes was present. Diagnostic considerations are discussed. b) In a 46-year-old male patient with subacute aleukemic leukemia of a pre-B-cell type diagnosed in 1981, the disease showed an unexpectedly benign course: after initial mild chemotherapy the patient has remained in a stable condition while off cytotoxic treatment for the last two years. Nevertheless, besides anemia necessitating regular transfusions, persistent agranulocytosis is present which is not explained by bone marrow infiltration. In vitro experiments suggest suppression of myelopoiesis by cellular interaction with leukemic cells or a deficiency of growth factors causing agranulocytosis. 3. An 81-year-old man showed signs and symptoms of lead intoxication which proved to be due to oral ingestion of a lead-containing ointment."
3172286,[Acute toxicity study of cefodizime sodium].,"Acute toxicity of cefodizime sodium (THR-221) was examined in mice of both sexes, rats of both sexes (including 5-day-old young), and male dogs. The LD50 values of THR-221 (mg/kg) were as follows: (1) mice: intravenous, 7200 for males and 5000 for females; intraperitoneal, 10500 for males and 11000 for females; subcutaneous, 17500 for males and 16500 for females; and oral, 28000 for males and 29000 for females. (2) rats (adult): intravenous, 7000 for males and 8200 for females; intraperitoneal, 9500 for males and 8800 for females; subcutaneous, 17000 for males and 15500 for females; oral, more than 20000 for both sexes; and intramuscular, more than 3200 for both sexes. (3) 5-day-old rats: subcutaneous, 5278 for males and 5314 for females. (4) male dogs: intravenous, more than 5000. Major changes in general conditions observed in mice and rats were decreased spontaneous activity, lying prone, respiratory changes, staggering gait, clonic or clonic-tonic convulsions, and cyanosis, and in the animals dosed orally, diarrhea or salivation was also noted. The changes in 5-day-old rats were respiratory changes, agony, loss of reflex to an external stimulus, and congestion at the injection site, and those in dogs were vomiting, dryness of the nose, and soft or mucous stools. Autopsies on the mice and rats which died revealed hemorrhage on the brain surface. In addition, the following were seen: intraperitoneal retention of fluid and dark red spots on the abdominal wall (i.p.), subcutaneous retention of fluid or jellylike material and hemorrhage at the injection site (s.c.), and retention of fluid and dark red spots on the mucosa in the digestive tract (mice p.o.). In 5-day-old rats which died, the subcutaneous tissue at the injection site showed hemorrhage macroscopically and inflammatory changes microscopically. Hematological and blood chemical tests performed in dogs showed an increase in white blood cells and changes suggesting anemia, increases in GOT, LDH and ALP activities, and slight changes in urea nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus. In one animal given a low dose of 2500 mg/kg, an increase in GPT activity was also seen. However, these changes were all transient. Microscopic findings in dogs were slight inflammatory changes in the subcutaneous tissue around the injection site."
3104251,A bleeding disorder (von Willebrand's disease) in a Himalayan cat.,"A bleeding disorder (von Willebrand's disease) was diagnosed in a 9-year-old male Himalayan cat examined because of persistent oral bleeding after routine dental extraction. Bleeding subsided after empirical treatment, which included prednisolone, vitamin K1, and transfusion of fresh blood, but recurred spontaneously after 8 months of apparent good health. Pertinent results of routine laboratory testing included an inconstant prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time and recurring iron-deficiency anemia. Assays of specific coagulation factors revealed low factor VIII coagulant activity and undetectable factor VIII-related antigen, a pattern considered to be diagnostic of von Willebrand's disease. This condition, not previously reported in a cat, should be included in the differential diagnosis when cats are examined because of abnormal bleeding."
2440780,"[Chronic hemorrhagic iron deficiency. Sources of hemorrhage, blood loss and systematic iron substitution].","In only 121/436 (28 per cent) patients with chronic haemorrhagic iron deficiency bleeding sources could be removed by appropriate management or healed spontaneously. In 61 per cent of all cases the disease lasted from 1 year to greater than 20 years. The fall of haemoglobin per month correlated closely with blood losses per month as calculated by determinations of 59Fe whole body iron loss. Over prolonged periods estimations of the magnitude of blood loss (range 1- greater than 721 per year) based on changes of the iron status under normal diets and under systematic iron substitution. Oral iron administration with appraisable bioavailability was able to compensate blood losses up to 151 and with increasing doses up to 361 per year with maintenance of normal or borderline haemoglobin values. However, side reactions increased considerably after years and with rising doses. Under such circumstances combinations of i.v. iron, oral iron and blood transfusions were successful over prolonged periods."
4068060,[Study on toxicity of halopredone acetate. (I) Acute toxicity study in mice and rats].,"Since halopredone acetate (THS-201), a synthetic corticosteroid, is expected to be used clinically for intra-articular injections because of its long-lasting activity in the synovial bursa, its acute toxicity was compared with that of triamsinolone acetonide (TA) and methylprednisolone acetate (MPA). The test animals were Jcl: ICR mice and Jcl: Wistar rats, and drugs were administered orally, intraperitoneally and subcutaneously. The LD50 values of THS-201 both in mice and rats were estimated more than 5000 mg/kg at each route, and these are for above larger than those of TA or MPA. Moreover, in oral and subcutaneous administration of THS-201, no severe toxic signs were observed either in mice or in rats. In intraperitoneal injection, a few of mice and rats died after showing several clinical signs and suppression of body weight gain, and their autopsy revealed atrophy of thymus, spleen and adrenal, induction of infection and hemorrhage in digestive tract. On the other hand, the mice and rats administered TA or MPA revealed the severe toxic signs such as loss of hair gloss, marked emaciation, decrease in spontaneous movement, anemia, bloated face, decrease or suppression of body weight gain, atrophy of thymus, spleen and adrenal, severe induction of infection and lesions in digestive tracts. Accordingly, it is concluded that the acute toxicity of THS-201 in mice and rats was lower than that of TA or MPA."
6730590,[Latent and manifest iron deficiency conditions. Diagnostic and therapeutic developments].,"The developments of the last 15 years rendered possible more exact clinical evidences on stages (cross section diagnoses of the iron state within the body), developmental forms (longitudinal section diagnoses with estimation of the iron balance) and substitution of the iron deficiency. In the stages I (storage iron deficiency with increased intestinal iron absorption) and II (additional decrease of the serum iron) haemoglobin lies within the normal. Iron deficiency anaemias without (III) and with (IV) tissue damage show much decreased serum ferritin values. In the pre-treatment or in complications by infections or tumours the dispersion areas of serum ferritin intersect with the lower dispersion area of the norm of control persons with normal reserves of iron. - The most frequent cause of the non-haemorrhagic iron deficiency developing by an absolute or relatively too small iron supply are pregnancies without an effective iron prophylaxis. The chronic haemorrhagic iron deficiency relapsing without iron supply is caused by hypermenorrhoeas (blood losses per year 1-6 l) and in older patients by blood losses from the gastro-intestinal canal (blood losses per year 1 to more than 30 l). The posthaemorrhagic or postpartal iron deficiency remaining after removal of the causes remits spontaneously with sufficient nutrition. A more exact knowledge about the bioavailability of oral ferroiron preparation and the biotransformation of parenterally administered colloidal iron preparation render possible a better adaptation of the iron substitution to the demand of iron to the limits of tolerability and metabolisability of the remedies administered."
6153471,Recent results of using a sequential combination of bleomycin and mitomycin C in the treatment of metastatic cervical cancer.,"Thirty patients with metastatic cervical cancer were treated using a sequential combination of bleomycin and mitomycin C. The total remission rate obtained in the patients objectively evaluated was 88.3%, which included a 65.3% complete remission rate and a 23% partial remission rate. No significant difference in response rate was found among the various metastatic sites. The average remission duration in complete responders was about 4.5 months. Without maintenance therapy, they inevitably relapsed. The oral administration of Carboquone (an analogue of mitomycin C) as maintenance therapy inhibited recurrence effectively, but produced several fatal effects such as severe anemia, infection, and intestinal bleeding. Six (20%) of the patients survived these effects and are still alive more than 2 years after the initiation of the therapy."
313737,[Digestive manifestations of Rendu-Osler's disease (author's transl)].,"Rendu-Osler disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder, autosomal dominent. Telangiectasia of the skin, face, trunk, upper and lower extremities are associated with angiomas of the oral and nasopharyngal membranes, lips, tongue and internal organs (intestine tract, liver, spleen, blood, lung, brain). They are source of melena, hematemesis, hematuria, hemoptysis with severe anemia.
dilated blood vessels forming cavernous spaces, flattened endothelial cells, no perivascular infiltration, degeneration of the perivascular connective tissue, elastic and muscular fibers missing around the vessels. Therefore hemorrhages are not able to stop spontaneously. Ultrastructural changes : formation of gaps along the thinned-out endothelial lining of dilated vessels, gaps plugged with thrombi. Anormal perivascular collagenous tissue, perivascular smooth muscles elongated and irregular in shape, did not surround the vessels. Liver cirrhosis and blood loss (gastrointestinal hemorrhages sometimes massive) are the only digestive manifestation of the severity. Systematic replacement of iron and blood transfusions are the most helpful forms of treatment."
5549181,"Maternal folate deficiency and pregnancy wastage. IV. Effects of folic acid supplements, anticonvulsants, and oral contraceptives.","A group of studies on indigent hospital patients were conducted on the role of folate supplements, pregnancy and oral contraceptives in megaloblastic anemia. First 25 pregnant women, given 500 mg iron dextran and 30 mg folic acid for 2-3 months, had 12.4% hemoglogin at delivery, compared with 49 women given only iron who had 12.5% hemoglobin, and 49 untreated women who had 11.3% hemoglobin. Second, plasma folate levels in groups of pregnant women were compared: mean folate was 4.7 ng/ml in 82 normal women, 3.1 in 21 treated epileptics, and about 1.2 in 31 women with megaloblastic anemia. In 77 pregnancies in 43 epileptic women there were no reasons to blame low folate levels for pregnancy wastage since no abruptio placentae or bleeding occurred; and incidence of low birth weight, perinatal death, and prematurity was lower than in the general population. Third, the effect of oral contraceptives on folate levels was observed. Mean plasma folate levels were 8.1 ng/ml in 55 control women, 8.0 in 57 women using the pill, 4.7 in normal women in late pregnancy, and about 1.1 in pregnant women with megaloblastic anemia. Fourth, mean hemoglobin levels rose from 7.6 to 13.4 9m/100 ml within a few weeks in 5 women with gestational megaloblastic anemia after treatment with normal diet, without supplement, and oral contraceptives. One woman with puerperal megaloblastic anemia failed to respond to a regular diet while taking Ovulen, 6 tablets daily. The results suggest that plasma folate levels were neither lower in oral contracepting women nor did the pill prevent the increase in folate in megaloblastic anemia patients treated with diet. Thus the authors concluded that folate supplement is not needed for pill users."

36304046,Mechanisms of Scarless Repair at Time of Menstruation: Insights From Mouse Models.,"The human endometrium is a remarkable tissue which may experience up to 400 cycles of hormone-driven proliferation, differentiation and breakdown during a woman's reproductive lifetime. During menstruation, when the luminal portion of tissue breaks down, it resembles a bloody wound with piecemeal shedding, exposure of underlying stroma and a strong inflammatory reaction. In the absence of pathology within a few days the integrity of the tissue is restored without formation of a scar and the endometrium is able to respond appropriately to subsequent endocrine signals in preparation for establishment of pregnancy if fertilization occurs. Understanding mechanisms regulating scarless repair of the endometrium is important both for design of therapies which can treat conditions where this is aberrant (heavy menstrual bleeding, fibroids, endometriosis, Asherman's syndrome) as well as to provide new information that might allow us to reduce fibrosis and scar formation in other tissues. Menstruation only occurs naturally in species that exhibit spontaneous stromal cell decidualization during the fertile cycle such as primates (including women) and the Spiny mouse. To take advantage of genetic models and detailed time course analysis, mouse models of endometrial shedding/repair involving hormonal manipulation, artificial induction of decidualization and hormone withdrawal have been developed and refined. These models are useful in modeling dynamic changes across the time course of repair and have recapitulated key features of endometrial repair in women including local hypoxia and immune cell recruitment. In this review we will consider the evidence that scarless repair of endometrial tissue involves changes in stromal cell function including mesenchyme to epithelial transition, epithelial cell proliferation and multiple populations of immune cells. Processes contributing to endometrial fibrosis (Asherman's syndrome) as well as scarless repair of other tissues including skin and oral mucosa are compared to that of menstrual repair."
36186844,Characteristics of menstrual cycles with or without intercourse in women with no known subfertility.,"Does sexual intercourse enhance the cycle fecundability in women without known subfertility?
Sexual intercourse (regardless of timing during the cycle) was associated with cycle characteristics suggesting higher fecundability, including longer luteal phase, less premenstrual spotting and more than 2 days of cervical fluid with estrogen-stimulated qualities.
Human females are spontaneous ovulators, experiencing an LH surge and ovulation cyclically, independent of copulation. Natural conception requires intercourse to occur during the fertile window of a woman's menstrual cycle, i.e. the 6-day interval ending on the day of ovulation. However, most women with normal fecundity do not ovulate on Day 14, thus the timing of the hypothetical fertile window varies within and between women. This variability is influenced by age and parity and other known or unknown elements. While the impact of sexual intercourse around the time of implantation on the probability of achieving a pregnancy has been discussed by some researchers, there are limited data regarding how sexual intercourse may influence ovulation occurrence and menstrual cycle characteristics in humans.
This study is a pooled analysis of three cohorts of women, enrolled at Creighton Model FertilityCare centers in the USA and Canada: 'Creighton Model MultiCenter Fecundability Study' (CMFS: retrospective cohort, 1990-1996), 'Time to Pregnancy in Normal Fertility' (TTP: randomized trial, 2003-2006) and 'Creighton Model Effectiveness, Intentions, and Behaviors Assessment' (CEIBA: prospective cohort, 2009-2013). We evaluated cycle phase lengths, bleeding and cervical mucus patterns and estimated the fertile window in 2564 cycles of 530 women, followed for up to 1 year.
Participants were US or Canadian women aged 18-40 and not pregnant, who were heterosexually active, without known subfertility and not taking exogenous hormones. Most of the women were intending to avoid pregnancy at the start of follow-up. Women recorded daily vaginal bleeding, mucus discharge and sexual intercourse using a standardized protocol and recording system for up to 1 year, yielding 2564 cycles available for analysis. The peak day of mucus discharge (generally the last day of cervical fluid with estrogen-stimulated qualities of being clear, stretchy or slippery) was used to identify the estimated day of ovulation, which we considered the last day of the follicular phase in ovulatory cycles. We used linear mixed models to assess continuous cycle parameters including cycle, menses and cycle phase lengths, and generalized linear models using Poisson regression with robust variance to assess dichotomous outcomes such as ovulatory function, short luteal phases and presence or absence of follicular or luteal bleeding. Cycles were stratified by the presence or absence of any sexual intercourse, while adjusting for women's parity, age, recent oral contraceptive use and breast feeding.
Most women were <30 years of age (75.5%; median 27, interquartile range 24-29), non-Hispanic white (88.1%), with high socioeconomic indicators and nulliparous (70.9%). Cycles with no sexual intercourse compared to cycles with at least 1 day of sexual intercourse were shorter (29.1 days (95% CI 27.6, 30.7) versus 30.1 days (95% CI 28.7, 31.4)), had shorter luteal phases (10.8 days (95% CI 10.2, 11.5) versus 11.4 days (95% CI 10.9, 12.0)), had a higher probability of luteal phase deficiency (<10 days; adjusted probability ratio (PR) 1.31 (95% CI 1.00, 1.71)), had a higher probability of 2 days of premenstrual spotting (adjusted PR 2.15 (95% CI 1.09, 4.24)) and a higher probability of having two or fewer days of peak-type (estrogenic) cervical fluid (adjusted PR 1.49 (95% CI 1.03, 2.15)).
Our study participants were geographically dispersed but relatively homogeneous in regard to race, ethnicity, income and educational levels, and all had male partners, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. We cannot exclude the possibility of undetected subfertility or related gynecologic disorders among some of the women, such as undetected endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome, which would impact the generalizability of our findings. Acute illness or stressful events might have reduced the likelihood of any intercourse during a cycle, while also altering cycle characteristics. Some cycles in the no intercourse group may have actually had undocumented intercourse or other sexual activity, but this would bias our results toward the null. The Creighton Model FertilityCare System (CrM) discourages use of barrier methods, so we believe that most instances of intercourse involved exposure to semen; however, condoms may have been used in some cycles. Our dataset lacks any information about the occurrence of female orgasm, precluding our ability to evaluate the independent or combined impact of female orgasm on cycle characteristics.
Sexual activity may change reproductive hormonal patterns, and/or levels of reproductive hormones may influence the likelihood of sexual activity. Future work may help with understanding the extent to which exposure to seminal fluid, and/or female orgasm and/or timing of intercourse could impact menstrual cycle function. In theory, large data sets from women using menstrual and fertility tracking apps could be informative if women can be appropriately incentivized to record intercourse completely. It is also of interest to understand how cycle characteristics may differ in women with gynecological problems or subfertility.

35721150,Update on Treatment of Infantile Hemangiomas: What's New in the Last Five Years?,"Among benign vascular tumors of infancy, hemangiomas are the commonest, affecting approximately 5-10% of one-year-old children. They are derived from a benign proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in the mesoderm and may arise anywhere on the body around 1-2 weeks after birth. Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are characterized by an early proliferative phase in the first year followed by a spontaneous progressive regression within the following 5 years or longer. IH prevalence is estimated to be 5%-10% in one-year-old children and commonly affects female, Caucasian and low-birth weight infants. Although most of them spontaneously regress, approximately 10% requires treatment to prevent complications due to the site of occurrence such as bleeding, ulceration, cosmetically disfigurement, functional impairment, or life-threatening complications. For over 30 years, steroids have represented the first-line treatment for IHs, but recently topical or systemic β-blockers are increasingly being used and recognized as effective and safe. A search for ""Cutaneous infantile hemangioma"" [All Fields] AND ""Treatment"" [All Fields] was performed by using PubMed and EMBASE databases. Treatment of IHs with labeled drugs, such as oral propranolol, but also with off-label drugs, such as topical β-blockers, including topical timolol and carteolol, steroids, itraconazole or sirolimus, with a focus on formulations types and adverse events were described in our review. We also discussed the benefits of pulsed dye laser and the treatment of IHs with involvement of central nervous system, namely the PHACE and LUMBAR syndrome."
34773322,Labyrinthine haemorrhage secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis.,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can rarely present with acute ipsilateral cochlear and/or vestibular loss, to date always in the absence of a clear local otogenic process evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This association has been putatively attributed to inner ear anoxia due to blockage of inner ear venous drainage. We present a nonreported case of thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses presenting with acute unilateral vestibulopathy in which MRI disclosed concurrent ipsilateral labyrinthine haemorrhage. A 69-year-old female presented with acute vertigo without hearing loss or other accompanying neurological symptoms. Bedside examination revealed spontaneous right-beating nystagmus and an impaired left head impulse response, with an otherwise normal neurological examination. Audiometry and head and ear computed tomography were unremarkable, whereas MRI showed a nonenhancing hyperintensity of the left inner ear consistent with labyrinthine haemorrhage, and additional venography disclosed thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Oral anticoagulation was started, and the patient experienced gradual improvement of symptoms. The current case provides support for the existence of inner ear anoxia in CVT cases presenting with acute ipsilateral vestibular loss, which can ultimately be complicated by secondary bleeding, as seen in our patient. Importantly, presentation in our case closely mimicked that of peripheral vestibular neuritis, and only MRI venography enabled us to make a prompt diagnosis. This raises an important question as to when a diagnosis of vestibular neuritis can be made securely in the absence of MRI assessment with or without venography to completely discard labyrinthine haemorrhage with or without CVT."
34393408,Self-correction of pathologic tooth migration after nonsurgical periodontal treatment in a metabolic syndrome patient with severe periodontitis and drug-influenced gingival enlargement.,"Drug-influenced gingival enlargement (DIGE) and reduced bone support caused by periodontitis are two of the etiologic factors for pathologic tooth migration (PTM). Comprehensive management, including surgical, orthodontic, and prosthodontic treatment, is usually required for recovery from severe DIGE and PTM. An 85-year-old Taiwanese male with a history of hypertension and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) visited our dental department for severe gingival enlargement and spontaneous bleeding. He was diagnosed as having advanced periodontitis and DIGE. Remarkable PTM occurred on the front sextants of his dentition. The patient's DM was gradually controlled, and his calcium channel blocker treatment was substituted with a new regimen for 7 months. One year after nonsurgical periodontal treatment and reinforcing the patient's oral care, both DIGE and PTM were spontaneously resolved without any surgical or orthodontic intervention. We advocate the value of early diagnosis, improving patient's oral hygiene, and meticulous nonsurgical treatment for both DIGE and PTM."
34177541,Subconjunctival Hemorrhage in a Child with the Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome on Treatment with Oral Propranolol.,"Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare syndrome characterized by venous malformations of mostly skin and gastrointestinal tract. Patients present with multiple venous malformations in various organs including liver, spleen, heart, eye, and central nervous system. Few ophthalmological cases have been published in literature and at present, there are no clear guidelines on the treatment of eye hemorrhages associated with the BRBNS. We report a 3-year-old boy with the BRBNS who developed a spontaneous progressive enlarging subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye despite being treated with oral propranolol. The subconjunctival hemorrhage was caused by an underlying conjunctival vascular malformation. With topical treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% once a day in the affected eye, the lesion regressed completely after 4 months. This child represents the first case of the BRBNS associated with a subconjunctival progressive bleeding necessitating topical treatment despite oral propranolol effectively controlling the cutaneous lesions. We recommend ophthalmic screening of patients with BRBNS in early childhood. For patients with BRBNS-related subconjunctival vascular lesions with subsequent hemorrhage, treatment with a topical β-blocker may be an efficient and harmless treatment option."
34123949,Spinal Cord Compression Secondary to a Spontaneous Spinal Haematoma in a Patient Newly Treated with Rivaroxaban.,"A 74-year-old patient anticoagulated with rivaroxaban for chronic atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency department with acute lumbar pain with progressive weakness of the lower limbs and inability to stand up. No previous trauma was reported. Neurological examination was consistent with a complete spinal cord syndrome at the level of T6. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of spinal cord compression associated with signs of extensive intramedullary inflammation secondary to a haematoma. The patient underwent thoracic laminectomy with evacuation of an intradural haematoma. No intraoperative complications were described, but no clinical improvement had been achieved 15 days after the surgical intervention.
Apixaban could be preferred as the first choice for direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) in older patients.DOACs can have important side effects even if the switch from vitamin K antagonist to this group is correctly carried out."
33368142,Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth.,"Respiratory morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a serious complication of preterm birth and the primary cause of early neonatal mortality and disability. Despite early evidence indicating a beneficial effect of antenatal corticosteroids on fetal lung maturation and widespread recommendations to use this treatment in women at risk of preterm delivery, some uncertainty remains about their effectiveness particularly with regard to their use in lower-resource settings, different gestational ages and high-risk obstetric groups such as women with hypertension or multiple pregnancies. This updated review (which supersedes an earlier review Crowley 1996) was first published in 2006 and subsequently updated in 2017.
To assess the effects of administering a course of corticosteroids to women prior to anticipated preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) on fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, maternal mortality and morbidity, and on the child in later life.
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (3 September 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, the databases that contribute to the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 September 2020), and reference lists of the retrieved studies.
We considered all randomised controlled comparisons of antenatal corticosteroid administration with placebo, or with no treatment, given to women with a singleton or multiple pregnancy, prior to anticipated preterm delivery (elective, or following rupture of membranes or spontaneous labour), regardless of other co-morbidity, for inclusion in this review.
We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, evaluated trustworthiness based on predefined criteria developed by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth, extracted data and checked them for accuracy, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included perinatal death, neonatal death, RDS, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), birthweight, developmental delay in childhood and maternal death.
We included 27 studies (11,272 randomised women and 11,925 neonates) from 20 countries. Ten trials (4422 randomised women) took place in lower- or middle-resource settings. We removed six trials from the analysis that were included in the previous version of the review; this review only includes trials that meet our pre-defined trustworthiness criteria. In 19 trials the women received a single course of steroids. In the remaining eight trials repeated courses may have been prescribed. Fifteen trials were judged to be at low risk of bias, two had a high risk of bias in two or more domains and we ten trials had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (placebo was not used in the control arm. Overall, the certainty of evidence was moderate to high, but it was downgraded for IVH due to indirectness; for developmental delay due to risk of bias and for maternal adverse outcomes (death, chorioamnionitis and endometritis) due to imprecision. Neonatal/child outcomes Antenatal corticosteroids reduce the risk of: - perinatal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.93; 9833 infants; 14 studies; high-certainty evidence; 2.3% fewer, 95% CI 1.1% to 3.6% fewer), - neonatal death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87; 10,609 infants; 22 studies; high-certainty evidence; 2.6% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% to 3.6% fewer), - respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 11,183 infants; studies = 26; high-certainty evidence; 4.3% fewer, 95% CI 3.2% to 5.2% fewer). Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of IVH (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; 8475 infants; 12 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 0.8% to1.8% fewer), and probably have little to no effect on birthweight (mean difference (MD) -14.02 g, 95% CI -33.79 to 5.76; 9551 infants; 19 studies; high-certainty evidence). Antenatal corticosteroids probably lead to a reduction in developmental delay in childhood (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 600 children; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 3.8% fewer, 95% CI 0.2% to 5.7% fewer). Maternal outcomes Antenatal corticosteroids probably result in little to no difference in maternal death (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.89; 6244 women; 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 0.0% fewer, 95% CI 0.1% fewer to 0.5% more), chorioamnionitis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.08; 8374 women; 15 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 0.5% fewer, 95% CI 1.1% fewer to 0.3% more), and endometritis (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.58; 6764 women; 10 studies; moderate-certainty; 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.3% fewer to 1.1% more) The wide 95% CIs in all of these outcomes include possible benefit and possible harm.
Evidence from this updated review supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids reduces the risk of perinatal death, neonatal death and RDS and probably reduces the risk of IVH. This evidence is robust, regardless of resource setting (high, middle or low). Further research should focus on variations in the treatment regimen, effectiveness of the intervention in specific understudied subgroups such as multiple pregnancies and other high-risk obstetric groups, and the risks and benefits in the very early or very late preterm periods. Additionally, outcomes from existing trials with follow-up into childhood and adulthood are needed in order to investigate any longer-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids. We encourage authors of previous studies to provide further information which may answer any remaining questions about the use of antenatal corticosteroids without the need for further randomised controlled trials. Individual patient data meta-analyses from published trials are likely to provide answers for most of the remaining clinical uncertainties."
31932128,Spontaneous splenic hemorrhage in a patient on apixiban.,"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly popular. Spontaneous splenic rupture is rare and life-threatening, especially if it is not immediately recognized. Prior work has demonstrated an association with NOAC use and spontaneous splenic rupture in unusual clinical circumstances. We present the case of spontaneous splenic hemorrhage in a largely healthy 57-year old female who was recently started on apixiban for a provoked PE. She had been discharged from an outside facility, and presented just hours after discharge to our emergency department in extremis: unconscious, pale, hypotensive, and tachycardic. Her abdomen on arrival was noted to be distended with positive fluid wave, and bedside ultrasound confirmed massive peritoneal fluid. Prompt diagnostic peritoneal aspirate confirmed hemoperitoneum, and a massive transfusion protocol was initiated. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate improved, and she was stabilized for imaging. Computed tomography demonstrated large subcapsular splenic hematoma with active extravasation at the periphery of the spleen. The patient was taken emergently to interventional radiology suite where splenic artery embolization was performed and an IVC filter was placed. She subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and persistent low urine output with hypotension despite resuscitation, and was taken to the operating room for splenectomy and abdominal washout. She improved thereafter and was discharged 12 days later. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive early resuscitation contributed to this patient's outcome."
30895969,"[DRESS syndrome, a differencial diagnosis in late postoperative complications].","The DRESS syndrome (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) is a serious pharmacodermia which must be taken into account when establishing an optimal early treatment to prevent a systemic and potentially lethal evolution. Pharmacodermias are the third most frequent cause of adverse effects during surgical hospitalization, after nosocomial infections and intraoperative complications. In most cases, they pose a challenge to the surgeon, since their onset is nonspecific and, therefore, can be easily mistaken for a surgery complication. We present the case of a 54-year-old man, healthy and without relevant background, who was operated on two times due to spontaneous abdominal bleeding. Three weeks after the last surgery, and coinciding with the administration of oral metamizole, the patient developed a DRESS syndrome. The initial unspecific deterioration, characteristic of this syndrome, is the main cause of the delay in diagnosis and correct treatment, causing the resulting evolution to systemic affectation."
26778730,Spontaneous convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage: Clinical series of 3 patients with associated cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"Convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage (cSAH) is a rare type of spontaneous, non-traumatic, and nonaneurysmal SAH characterised by blood collections in one or more cortical sulci in the convexity of the brain; the aetiology varies. We report a clinical case series of 3 patients with cSAH associated with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) who presented with focal sensory seizures and responded well to corticosteroid treatment.
Case 1 was a 67-year-old man reporting right-sided paroxysmal sensory episodes with Jacksonian progression, cheiro-oral symptoms, and motor dysphasia. Case 2 was a 79-year-old man reporting left-sided paroxysmal episodes with cheiro-oral signs and dysarthria. Case 3 was a 71-year-old woman also reporting recurrent left cheiro-oral signs and dysarthria. None of the patients had headache or clinical dementia. Aneurysms were ruled out using MR angiography.
Brain CT scan detected an isolated hyperintensity in a sulcus of the frontal convexity; brain gradient echo T2-weighted MRI sequences showed meningeal haemosiderosis and microbleeds. However, no atrophy was identified in medial temporal lobes including the hippocampal formation. All patients had low levels of beta-amyloid in CSF, low values on the Hulstaert index and high levels of phosphorylated tau protein. Patients were initially treated with prednisone and levetiracetam, but symptoms recurred in 2 patients after prednisone was discontinued.
We present a series of 3 patients with cSAH associated with CAA, characterised by a stereotypical syndrome responding well to corticoid treatment; there were no cases of headache or clinical dementia."
26372311,An evaluation of the severity and progression of epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 versus hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2.,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia whose hallmark symptom is spontaneous recurrent epistaxis. Two major genetic subtypes of this syndrome are HHT1 and HHT2. Severity of epistaxis ranges from occasional low-volume bleeding to frequent large-volume hemorrhage. This study evaluated the severity and progression of epistaxis in HHT1 versus HHT2.
Retrospective cohort study.
A retrospective chart review was performed for 183 genotyped HHT patients seen at our center from 2010 to 2013. Data collected included epistaxis severity score (ESS), age of epistaxis onset, number and type of treatments, age at which treatments were sought, complete blood count values, ferritin, number of telangiectases, blood transfusions, iron therapy history, and patient demographics.
115 subjects with HHT2 were compared to 68 with HHT1. Subjects with HHT2 had a higher ESS compared to HHT1 (P = .043) and a later age of onset of epistaxis (P = .005). HHT2 subjects were more likely to use oral iron (P = .032) and were more likely to seek interventions to control their epistaxis (P = .029).
HHT2 is associated with more severe epistaxis and a subsequent higher rate of interventions, requiring more aggressive therapy as compared to HHT1.

26101006,Per Oral Bleeding: Rare Presentation of Gardner-Diamond Syndrome.,"A10-year boy presented with spontaneous episodes of oral bleeding for the last 6 months. Detailed ENT examination showed no pathology, bleeding profile was normal, endoscopy and dental examination also did not reveal any abnormality. Child abuse or malingering was also ruled out. Initially the child was managed with platelet transfusion and fresh frozen plasma and then put on follow-up treatment with antifibrinolytics, Vitamin C but the episodes became recurrent. Psychiatric evaluation revealed that child was suffering from depression. Antidepressants were prescribed by the psychiatrist that not only cured the depression with time but also the bleeding episodes which were actually related to child's depression (Gardner-Diamond syndrome or psychogenic purpura). This is a diagnosis by exclusion where the patients bleed due to dysregulated steroid secretion secondary to stress; resulting in development of sensitization to RBC membrane, and dysregulated fibrinolytic system activity."
24861403,Expression of nuclear receptors of gingiva in polycystic ovarian syndrome: a preliminary case study.,"Oestrogen is mainly responsible for alterations in blood vessels and progesterone stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators. In females, during puberty, ovulation and pregnancy, there is an increase in the production of sex steroid hormones, which results in increased gingival inflammation, characterized by gingival enlargement, increased bleeding and crevicular fluid flow. This article presents a case of a patient who presented with a complaint of gingival swelling and spontaneous bleeding that persisted for more than two months. Her health history documented the recently diagnosed presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Clinical examination revealed enlarged painful gingival tissues, which bled when touched. After completion of Phase I therapy, the enlargement did not subside and a biopsy sample was taken. This was compared with another patient who had the same health condition but did not show any gingival enlargement. Testing of tissue samples for oestrogen and progesterone receptors showed the first patient to be positive for oestrogen receptors but negative for progesterone, whereas the control was negative for both. Positive oestrogen receptors suggest that polycystic ovarian syndrome has some effect on the periodontium. The dental consequences of this condition, highly prevalent among young females, are typically ignored. Further studies warrant establishment of a clinical association and future diagnosis."
24306104,Spontaneous and non-spontaneous bleeding complications in patients with oral vitamin K antagonist therapy.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate potential differences between patients with spontaneous and non-spontaneous bleeding episodes during treatment with vitamin K antagonists which mainly resulted in compartment syndromes.
The population in this study comprised 116 patients who suffered at least one bleeding complication which required surgical treatment during therapy with an oral vitamin K antagonist. The patients were treated between September 2001 and July 2008.
Significant differences were observed between the two patient groups with regard to the presence of renal failure, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, which occurred more frequently in patients with spontaneous bleeding. Also, significantly more patients with spontaneous bleedings developed compartment syndrome that needed emergency operation. Overall mortality was 9.6 %, was associated with multiorgan failure in all patients, and was not different between the two patient groups.
The identification of high-risk patients before treatment with an oral vitamin K antagonist is of major importance. The existence of over-anticoagulation syndrome and compartment syndrome is associated with significant mortality and morbidity and should not be underestimated."

21766176,Influence of heart-valve replacement of warfarin anticoagulant therapy on perinatal outcomes.,"To explore the influence of the single use of perinatal warfarin anticoagulation therapy on pregnancy outcome after the mechanical heart-valve replacement surgery in pregnant women.
Fifty-eight cases of pregnant women after heart-valve replacement surgery (2005.1-2009.12) received low-dose warfarin anticoagulation therapy. The perinatal outcomes included: (1) maternal complications: thrombosis, hemorrhage, heart failure, etc., and (2) adverse perinatal outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death, fetal malformation, preterm delivery, such as warfarin syndrome.
In 58 patients, valve thrombosis was found in one case of pregnancy, general hemorrhage was found in 16 cases, spontaneous abortion was found in two cases, malformation was found in two cases. There were no stillbirth and neonatal death. Three cases were premature delivery. Thirty-two of 56 cases were late pregnancy vaginal delivery. Twenty-four cases were cesarean section produced, in which heart failure happened in 1 case and late postpartum hemorrhage happened in one case.
The low-dose and low-intensity warfarin anticoagulation therapy during pregnancy is good for patients with good compliance and low rate of fetal malformations and can effectively prevent maternal complications."
21180586,A clinical guide to using intravenous proton-pump inhibitors in reflux and peptic ulcers.,"Intravenous (IV) proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are potent gastric acid suppressing agents, and their use is popular in clinical practice. Both IV and oral PPIs have similarly short half-lives, and their effects on acid secretion are similar, thus their dosing and dosage intervals appear to be interchangeable. The possible exception is when sustained high pHs are required to promote clot stabilization in bleeding peptic ulcers. Continuous infusion appears to be the only form of administration that reliably achieves these high target pHs. IV PPI is indicated in the treatment of high-risk peptic ulcers, complicated gastroesophageal reflux, stress-induced ulcer prophylaxis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and whenever it is impossible or impractical to give oral therapy. The widespread use of PPIs has been controversial. IV PPIs have been linked to the development of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive care setting and to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients.

Hyperplastic lesions affect the gingiva, causing massive spontaneous bleeding.
 We report a retrospective study of 11 patients affected by Sturge-Weber syndrome, with generalized gingival hyperplasia and angiomatous lesions of the oral cavity. Traditional scalpel surgery was performed in three patients; the remaining eight underwent laser gingivectomy. Specifically, four were treated with electrosurgery and a CO2 laser, and the remaining four patients were treated with a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser at 1.06, with a power of 4 or 6 W. In order to measure the patients' pain response, we used a visual analog scale. We clinically evaluated the tissue response and the possible presence of relapse in the surgically-treated areas.
  The three patients treated with traditional surgery had a relapse between 17 and 24 months after surgery. The four patients treated with the CO2 laser had a relapse between 36 and 42 months after surgery in 75% of cases.
  The most encouraging results were achieved using the neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser; patients treated with this procedure had a relapse 5 years and 4 months from surgery in only 25% of cases."
20078960,[Plasma metastin in adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome.].,"This study was designed to investigate the correlationship between plasma metastin and pathogenesis of adolescent women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
From Jan. 2006 to Jun. 2006, 42 PCOS patients including 19 adolescent women and 23 adults with syndrome were treated in Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. According to the range of age, those patients were divided into 19 cases in adolescent group (</= 19 years) and 23 cases in adult group (> 19 years). Meanwhile, 20 adolescent women were matched as controls. Blood samples were collected between day 1 and day 5 of a spontaneous bleeding episode in the PCOS groups and a menstrual cycle of the controls. The levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), free T (FT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin, glucose, and metastin were detected from day 1 to day 5 of spontaneous bleeding or withdrawal bleeding by progesterone. On the next day, oral glucose tolerance test (75 g) and insulin release test were performed on those above patients and controls. The area under curve (AUC), the ratio of fasting blood glucose to insulin (GIR) and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were calculated.
(1) The level of hormone: the level of LH was in (12 +/- 7) U/L in adult group and (12 +/- 8) U/L in adolescent PCOS group, which were significantly higher than (6 +/- 4) U/L in controls (P < 0.05). The level of FT was (2.3 +/- 1.2) pmol/L in adult group, which was significantly higher than (1.3 +/- 0.8) pmol/L in adolescent group and (1.1 +/- 0.5) pmol/L in control group (P < 0.05). It was observed that the level of (3.1 +/- 2.7)micromol/L in adolescent group was significantly lower than (6.3 +/- 2.7) micromol/L in control group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the level of FAI of 5.6 +/- 4.1 in adult group was significantly higher than 3.0 +/- 1.3 in control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference in FSH, T and SHBG levels among three groups were observed (P > 0.05). (2) Metastin and metabolism: Both the levels of fasting blood insulin, 2-hour insulin and AUC of insulin were (13 +/- 7) mU/L, (88 +/- 59) mU/L and (133 +/- 80) mUxL(-1)xmin(-1) in adolescent group, which were significantly higher than (7 +/- 3) mU/L, (57 +/- 29) mU/L and (82 +/- 34) mUxL(-1)xmin(-1) in control group. The fasting blood insulin of (13 +/- 7) mU/L in adolescent group was significantly higher than (9 +/- 5) mU/L in adult group. The level of fasting blood glucose and 2-hour glucose were (5.01 +/- 0.44) mmol/L and (6.48 +/- 1.16) mmol/L in adult group, which were significantly higher than (4.68 +/- 0.29) mmol/L and (5.44 +/- 0.83) mmol/L in control group and (4.67 +/- 0.30) mmol/L and (5.93 +/- 1.44) mmol/L in adolescent group. The glucose AUC of (9.99 +/- 1.85) mmolxL(-1)xmin(-1) in adult group was significantly higher than (8.42 +/- 1.53) mmolxL(-1)xmin(-1) in control group (P < 0.05). HOMA-IR of 2.6 +/- 2.0 in adolescent group was significantly higher than 1.4 +/- 0.7 in control group. GIR of 10 +/- 8 in adolescent group was significantly lower than 16 +/- 10 in control group (P < 0.05). The metastin level of (0.25 +/- 0.19) pmol/L in adolescent group and (0.29 +/- 0.29) pmol/L in adult group were all significantly higher than (0.18 +/- 0.23) pmol/L in control group (PPh glucose were observed (r = 0.256, 0.286 and 0.267. P = 0.044, 0.025 and 0.043).
The expression of metastin in adolescent PCOS women was significantly higher that of normal adolescent women. The increased level of metastin might be associated with pathogenesis of adolescent women with PCOS."
19126929,Acute myocardial infarction in two young women without significant risk factors.,"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an uncommon cause of acute coronary syndrome in young healthy females, with pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptive pills as recognized predisposing factors. We present two cases of acute myocardial infarction in two young females without significant risk factors and review the literature on spontaneous coronary artery dissection including diagnosis and treatment options."
18787800,Chronic fatigue syndrome: a hormonal origin? A rare case of dysmenorrhea membranacea.,"Membranous dysmenorrhea is a rare entity involving expulsion of fragments of endometrium retaining the shape of the uterus. The condition is often linked to high progesterone levels. An association with a chronic fatigue syndrome was never described.
A 44-year-old woman with a chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), presented with membranous dysmenorrhea after taking an oral contraceptive pill containing ethinylestradiol 0.02 mg and desogestrel 0.15 mg for 3 months in a continuous regimen as treatment for dysfunctional bleeding. Oral contraception was discontinued and she resumed normal menstruations. Remarkably, she mentioned complete disappearance of the CFS since expulsion of the tissue and started working again.
The occurrence of membranous dysmenorrhea with a dissolving chronic fatigue syndrome is very rare and was never described before. This case suggests a hormonal dysfunction as a possible cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. A review of the literature on membranous dysmenorrhea is presented."
18164999,Radiation carotid blowout syndrome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: angiographic features and endovascular management.,"To report clinical manifestations, angiographic features, and outcomes of endovascular management in 14 patients with 15 radiation carotid blowout syndromes of nasopharyngeal carcinomas.
Retrospective chart review of 14 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (mean age 49 years) with 15 radiation carotid blowout syndromes who had undergone endovascular embolization to manage oronasal bleeding in the past 10 years.
Average radiation dose to affected carotid artery was 73 gray units (latent period: 33 months). Radiation carotid blowout syndrome was detected in internal (n = 10), external (n = 4), or common carotid artery (n = 1). Detachable balloons were used in 11 affecting arteries for vascular occlusion; 4 were treated by liquid adhesives or coil. Endovascular treatment was successful in all 15 radiation carotid blowout syndromes with cessation of hemorrhage. One patient had hemiparesis after embolization. Mean clinical follow-up was 21 months.
Radiation carotid blowout syndrome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma may occur in various periods or arteries. Endovascular embolization provides both safe and effective management."
16966109,Antibiotic administration to patients with preterm labor and intact membranes: is there a beneficial effect in patients with endocervical inflammation?,"To determine whether broad-spectrum antibiotic administration to patients with preterm labor and intact membranes is associated with an improvement in neonatal and maternal outcomes, particularly in patients with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) or endocervical inflammation (ECI).
A prospective clinical trial was conducted in which women in premature labor were alternately allocated to receive either antibiotics or placebo, and information about MIAC and ECI collected. Eighty-four pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation with spontaneous preterm labor were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were cervical dilatation greater than 3 cm, clinical chorioamnionitis, abruption, rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding, and several additional fetal and maternal conditions that may influence perinatal outcome. Amniocentesis was offered to all patients and the cervix and vagina were sampled for microbiological and cytological studies. Eligible patients were allocated to receive either clindamycin-gentamycin or placebo for 7 days. Corticosteroids and tocolysis with beta-adrenergic agents were used according to the standard management of our institution. MIAC was defined as the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture obtained by trans-abdominal amniocentesis. ECI was diagnosed when a significant increase in the white blood cell count of the endocervical secretions was found. A composite neonatal morbidity/mortality outcome was created, including severe neonatal morbidity (respiratory distress syndrome, asphyxia, sepsis, pneumonia, intraventricular hemorrhage) and mortality.
Thirty-nine women received antibiotics and 40 received placebo. The prevalence of ECI and MIAC in both groups was comparable (antibiotic group ECI 61.5% (24/39) and MIAC 20.5% (8/39); placebo group ECI 62.5% (25/40) and MIAC 20% (8/40); p > 0.05). Overall, there were no significant differences in maternal infections and composite neonatal outcomes between antibiotic and placebo groups. Women who received antibiotics had a lower rate of subsequent rupture of membranes compared to patients who received placebo (2.6% (1/39) vs. 25% (10/40), respectively; p = 0.007). A sub-analysis showed that among patients with ECI, antibiotic administration was associated with a lower rate of composite neonatal morbidity/mortality outcome compared to those who received placebo (4.2% (1/24) vs. 28% (7/25), respectively; p < 0.05). This association was also present in patients with ECI without MIAC (0% (0/16) vs. 27.8% (5/18); p < 0.05), but not in patients with ECI and MIAC (antibiotic group 12.5% (1/8) vs. placebo group 28.6% (2/7); p > 0.05).
The combination of antibiotics used in this study did not improve maternal or perinatal outcome in patients with preterm labor and intact membranes. Further studies are required to determine if women with endocervicitis presenting with preterm labor and intact membranes may benefit from antibiotic administration."
16159061,Emergent endovascular treatment with direct carotid puncture for exsanguinating Carotid Blowout Syndrome.,"Carotid Blowout Syndrome (CBS) carries an exceedingly high mortality rate. Various established endovascular techniques are successful in treating less acute CBS, but exsanguinating patients with hemodynamic compromise continue to pose a significant clinical challenge.
We report a 53-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue presented with a sentinel hemoptysis followed by a massive oral hemorrhage. The patient suffered a cardiac arrest secondary to acute blood loss, from which he was successfully resuscitated.
An occlusion technique is presented involving direct carotid puncture for successful treatment of hemodynamically unstable, exsanguinating patients.
This technique accomplishes rapid arrest of exsanguination, minimal hemorrhage site manipulation, and successful carotid occlusion."
15937580,Insulin responses to the oral glucose tolerance test in women of different ethnicity with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"To evaluate insulin responses to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in women of different ethnic origins diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
We evaluated 92 women diagnosed with PCOS. Their ethnic origins were Western European (n = 41), Middle Eastern (n = 18), African American (n = 15), East Indian (n = 9), and South American (n = 9). The clinical diagnosis of PCOS included at least 3 of the following symptoms: menstrual disturbances (amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea); ovulatory infertility, hirsutism, and elevated serum testosterone (> or = 2.0 nmol/L); or a luteinizing hormone/ follicle-stimulating hormone ratio of > or = 3. The diagnosis was also supported by ultrasonographic changes revealing the presence of multiple small antral follicles distributed peripherally. All investigations were performed after an overnight fast on days 2 through 5 of a spontaneous menstrual cycle or progesteroneinduced withdrawal bleeding. The women underwent an OGTT with a glucose loading of 75 g. The responses of glucose and insulin to the OGTT were analyzed as the area under the curve (AUC) and were calculated with the trapezoidal method.
There were no significant differences in age or body mass index (BMI) among the different ethnic groups. All groups showed endocrine changes consistent with PCOS, but there were no differences in the hormonal levels among them. Middle Eastern women had higher AUC, glucose (P < 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-3.5), and insulin (P < 0.04; 95% CI, 13.3-593.4) levels than did women with Western European origin.
Middle Eastern women with PCOS expressed different insulin responses to OGTT than did Western European women, suggesting that Middle Eastern women with PCOS had poor carbohydrate metabolism."
12800449,Spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the coronary artery. A rare cause of myocardial infarction and sudden death.,"Spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the coronary artery (SDACA) not associated with aortic aneurysm or trauma is a very rare cause of myocardial ischemia. It has a higher prevalence in otherwise healthy women, especially in the peri- and postpartum period. In 80-90% of cases the diagnosis of SDACA is confirmed at autopsy, as the majority of patients present with acute myocardial infarction or sudden death. We describe the case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who died suddenly without any previous sign of cardiac disease. She had no clinical signs of Marfan's syndrome or arterial hypertension, she used no oral contraceptives and she was not in the peri- or postpartum period. At autopsy we found a recent dissecting aneurysm of the right coronary artery. Histology showed a hematoma between the media and adventitia of the coronary artery, flattening and occluding the lumen. Acute myocardial infarction was present in the posterior wall of the left cardiac ventricle. SDACA is an unpredictable condition and prompt diagnosis and life-saving procedures--either surgical or conservative--are rarely successful. We report a very rare disease documented in only 108 cases according to the English-language literature accessible to us."
11773906,Long QT syndrome: diagnosis and management.,"Long QT syndrome (LQT) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, causing torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. The LQT is a disorder of cardiac repolarization caused by alterations in the transmembrane potassium and sodium currents. Congenital LQT is a disease of transmembrane ion-channel proteins. Six genetic loci of the disease have been identified. Sporadic cases of the disease occur as a result of spontaneous mutations. The acquired causes of LQT include drugs, electrolyte imbalance, marked bradycardia, cocaine, organophosphorus compounds, subarachnoid hemorrhage, myocardial ischemia, protein sparing fasting, autonomic neuropathy, and human immunodeficiency virus disease.
Data on the diagnosis and management of LQT were thoroughly reviewed.
The diagnosis of LQT primarily rests on clinical and electrocardiographic features and family history. The clinical presentations range from dizziness to syncope and sudden death. Genetic screening is available primarily as a research tool. Short-term treatment of LQT is aimed at preventing the recurrences of torsades and includes intravenous magnesium and potassium administration, temporary cardiac pacing, withdrawal of the offending agent, correction of electrolyte imbalance, and, rarely, intravenous isoproterenol administration. The long-term treatment is aimed at reducing the QT-interval duration and preventing the torsades and sudden death and includes use of oral beta-adrenergic blockers, implantation of permanent pacemaker/cardioverter-defibrillator, and left thoracic sympathectomy. Sodium channel blockers are promising agents under investigation. Electrocardiograms are recorded for screening of family members. The data favor treating asymptomatic patients, if <40 years old at the time of diagnosis, with beta-adrenergic blockers."
10534081,"Gingival hemorrhage, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia. A case report.","Myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) presenting as spontaneous gingival hemorrhage is described. Gingival hemorrhage is recognized as a symptom of MDS, a rare group of potentially fatal hematological disorders, but it has not previously been documented as a presenting sign. The diagnostic pitfalls are discussed with the case, and the need for careful interpretation of laboratory findings in conjunction with clinical signs is emphasized. Finally, the MDSs are defined, classified and discussed with respect to their relevance to the clinical periodontist, from a diagnostic, therapeutic, and management standpoint."
9487334,Increased sensitivity of factor IX to phenprocoumon as a cause of bleeding in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody associated thrombosis.,"We report one patient who presented with a spontaneous bleeding complication under phenprocoumon therapy. Oral anticoagulation was initiated due to deep-vein thrombosis which was attributed to an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Coagulation analysis revealed a strong and selective reduction of factor IX (F IX) activity to 1%, whereas the other vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, X), the prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were within the therapeutic range. After withdrawal of phenprocoumon, all vitamin K-dependent factors including F IX normalized. Because the patient suffered from a recurrence of thrombotic events, he was re-exposed to phenprocoumon and the disproportionate decline of F IX was observed again. These findings indicate an increased sensitivity of F IX to vitamin K antagonists, representing an uncommon mechanism associated with bleeding complications under oral anticoagulant treatment."
9409404,Risk factors of moyamoya disease in Canada and the USA.,"Over the past 28 years, 39 patients with Moyamoya disease or syndrome defined as spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis with extensive basal collateral vessels have been treated by the author in Canada and the USA. All patients presented with clinical or radiologic evidence of hemorrhage (23) or ischemia and infarction (16). A total of 12 patients had associated cerebral aneurysms and seven of these patients with aneurysms presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patients ages ranged from 5 to 47 years. Of these 58% were female. The patients racial origin included North American Indian, Innuit, East Indian/Pakistani, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Malayasian, Hispanic, African American and Caucasian. Familial clustering was seen in North American Indian, Innuit and Caucasian patients. Associated disorders (tuberculosis, pharyngitis, thalassemia, fibromuscular hyperplasia, polycystic kidney, sickle cell trait and hypertension) were common in these patients, as was the use of tobacco, alcohol and in the adult females, oral contraceptives. It may be concluded from this series that the etiology of Moyamoya disease or syndrome is probably multifactorial, but that some racial and familial groups are more susceptible. Furthermore, in that the clinical and angiographic features are identical, the separation between Moyamoya disease and syndrome may not be helpful in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of this disorder."
7632863,[Apnoeic oxygenation in Boerhaave syndrome].,"Boerhaave's syndrome (Hermann Boerhaave, 1724 [5]) stands for the atraumatic spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus, and still represents a life-threatening situation. Contrary to the surgical approach, the anaesthesiological management has been largely neglected so far.
The present case report introduces a patient requiring surgical therapy due to a belatedly diagnosed rupture of the oesophagus. In agreement with the surgeon, endotracheal intubation was performed using a single-lumen oral Woodbridge tube. During left thoracotomy, artificial ventilation sometimes obstructed the surgeons. Following a life-threatening intrathoracic venous bleeding (after additional right thoracotomy), the situation became almost adverse, since the surgeon could not stop the bleeding due to the movement of the lungs. Ventilation was therefore stopped. The oxygen supply was provided 20 min by application of the so-called apnoeic oxygenation, first described in 1908 by the German surgeon Franz Volhard (15). Using the filled 2.5l reservoir bag of the circle circuit as the oxygen source (CPAP 10 cm H2O), oxygenation was maintained by refilling the bag after its volume had been decreased due to the patient's ongoing O2 consumption. Starting with an initial paO2 value of only 400mmHg (despite pAO2 approximately 670 mmHg, i.e. intrapulmonary right-left shunt of approx. 10-15%), the paO2 declined to 100 mmHg during the 20 min of apnoeic oxygenation (i.e. a drop by 15 mmHg per minute), whereas arterial pCO2 increased by 50 mmHg to a value of 90 mmHg, as stated recently in literature [18]). No relevant changes of ECG, heart rate, blood pressure and partial arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oxymeter) occurred.
During thoracic operations adverse situations may arise from the two antipodes artificial ventilation and acceptable surgical access. Alternative respiratory techniques, e.g. one-lung anaesthesia and/or high-frequency jet ventilation, are not always applicable, although the present case report indicates that a double lumen tube should be recommended. However, the clinical use of oxygenation by apnoeic oxygenation is a useful measure that can be realised in a simple and safe manner. The present case report may help to consider this particular alternative also during thoracic surgery (no influence of FRC size on pAO2 decrease). If applied correctly, apnoeic oxygenation obviously increases both the flexibility of the anaesthesist and patient safety, and additionally provides the ability of safe acting in clinical routine settings as well as during emergencies. In summary, knowledge of this technique of oxygenation seems to be an integral part of serious anaesthesiological education and clinical management."
7676276,Puerperal acquired factor VIII inhibitor causing a von Willebrand-like syndrome in a patient with anti-DNA antibodies.,"A 30-year-old Malay lady, with no previous or family history of bleeding, presented with severe gum bleeding 25 days post-partum. The factor VIII:c was 0.03 iu/ml with evidence of a slow-acting factor VIII inhibitor. Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:age) varied from less that 0.05 to 0.17 iu/ml, and there was absent ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation. Anti-nuclear and anti-DNA antibodies were present, but there were no other features of systemic lupus erythematosus. There was some clinical response to cryoprecipitate and tranexamic acid, and slight improvement with corticosteroid. Fifteen months later, the patient has no active bleeding problem, and her VWF-ag is increasing spontaneously. However, factor VIII:c is less than 0.01 iu/ml and her factor VIII inhibitor titre is still > 20 Bethesda units/ml."
8048682,[The acceptability of current contraceptive methods to adolescents].,"The authors analyze the admissibility of present-day contraception methods in 107 adolescent girls who used oral anteovin and trisiston and in 128 ones who used copper-containing IUDs. Analysis has not revealed noticeable differences in the incidence of side effects in adolescents and a control group of women of a reproductive age. Spontaneous menses recovery occurred in all young patients within 26 to 36 days after the drugs were discontinued, and basal temperature biphasic pattern recovered in 70.2% of girls by the third month after IUD contraception discontinuation. Short courses (up to 6-12 months) of hormonal contraception are advisable for adolescents. IUD contraception complications presenting as expulsions and menstrual cycle disorders were 1.5-2 times more incident in the adolescents than in control women despite the preventive measures taken.
A total of 235 adolescents aged 15-20 years were investigated, of whom 107 (Group I) were using oral contraceptives (OCs) (Trisiston and Anteovin) and 128 (Group II) were using IUDs containing copper: Cu 7-mini, Medusa, and T Cu 200. In addition, 215 women aged 20-35 years were studied in two more groups: 115 were using the OCs Anteovin and Trikvilar (Group III) and 100 were using the IUDs T Cu 200, Cu 7-Standard, and Medusa 1, 2, and 3 (Group IV). The reliability of OCs proved to be complete without even one unplanned pregnancy, while there were 4 such cases in Group II and 3 cases in Group IV. Side effects affected 9.3% among women using OCs in Groups I and III compared to only 7.5% in women at the midpoint of reproductive age. Group I experienced dyspepsia, reduction of work performance, and change in libido, while Group III experienced mammary tension and intermenstrual bleeding. 94.4% of patients in Group I and 94.6% of women in Group III had a menstrual cycle of 28.1 +or- 0.6 days at the beginning of OC use; compared to 27-29 days after the first cycle under OC treatment. Premenstrual syndrome and oligomenorrhea were found in 46.7% of adolescents using OCs and 12.3% of adult OC users at the beginning of treatment; however, by the third month of use menstrual disorders disappeared in all patients, and premenstrual syndrome as well as mammary tension occurred 2-5 days before menstruation in only 2.6% of women in Group III. Among IUD users complications were reported in 9.4% of Group II and 6.3% of Group IV. The frequency of expulsion was around 1.2-2.2 (mean 1.53) per 100 women in the course of 1 year in the adolescent users and 0.67 in Group IV patients. After 4 months of IUD use 73% of adolescents and 80% of women in Group IV experienced bleeding, while IUD removal because of hyperpolymenorrhea had to be done in 1.2% of Group II and 0.7% of Group IV users."
1952671,Bilateral arteriovenous malformation of the mandible.,"Spontaneous bleeding from the molar gingiva may reflect the presence of a life-threatening vascular malformation. Sporadic reports of exsanguinating hemorrhage in the dental literature warn of the dangers of extraction, although deaths from unrecognized lesions or secondary to mandibular fracture still occur. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may be either unilateral or, less commonly, bilateral, and should be suspected in individuals with large lower facial hemangiomata. Two cases of near-exsanguinating hemorrhage from bilateral AVMs are discussed with the long-term management over a 3- to 20-year follow-up. The report underscores the failure of therapeutic embolization and the need for computed tomographic scanning as a corollary to angiography. A newer treatment with direct removal of the AVM and obliteration methods solves the hemorrhagic complications, reduces the potential for steal syndromes, and reduces the potential for recurrence."
2737389,[Can septicemia and ascitic fluid infections in cirrhotic patients be treated by the oral route alone?].,"The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of oral antibiotics in the treatment of severe infections in cirrhosis. Twenty-two patients (17 males, 5 females) with spontaneous bacteremia (n = 7) or bacterial peritonitis (n = 15) were treated with oral pefloxacin 400 mg per 24 hr alone (n = 1) or in combination with another oral antibiotic, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (n = 13), amoxicillin (n = 6), cefadroxil (n = 2), or metronidazole (n = 1). In patients with spontaneous bacteremia, all organisms were found to be sensitive to oral antibiotics, and a favorable response was elicited in 6 out of 7 (86 p. cent) within 3 days (mean) of treatment. In patients with spontaneous peritonitis, ascitic fluid cultures were positive in 11 cases, and organisms were sensitive to pefloxacin in 9 out of 11 cases. A favorable response was elicited in 13 out of 15 within 2 to 8 days of treatment. Fourteen patients died (64 p. cent), 3 of infection (bacteremia n = 1, peritonitis n = 2), and 11 patients of causes unrelated to infection, mainly variceal hemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatocellular carcinoma, although the clinical symptoms of infection were controlled. One-year survival was 57 p. cent in patients with bacteremia and 33 p. cent in those with bacterial peritonitis. Oral treatment was well tolerated in all patients. We suggest that most bacteremia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can be treated with oral antibiotics. In some patients, this may be accomplished on an out patient basis."
3512575,Pregnancy in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Our experience regarding 98 pregnancies in 57 patients.,"Ninety-eight pregnancies in 57 patients with mechanical (ball or tilting disc) prosthetic heart valves are described. Sixty-one pregnancies developed in 36 patients with a mitral prosthesis, 12 pregnancies in 9 patients with an aortic prosthesis, 17 pregnancies in 10 patients with both mitral and aortic prostheses and 8 pregnancies in 2 patients with mitral and tricuspid prostheses. All patients were in I or in II NYHA class at conception and no significative change was noted during pregnancy. All the patients were treated with oral anticoagulant therapy at conception. Different kinds of antithrombotic and antiembolic prophylaxis were employed. There were 13 voluntary interruptions of pregnancy and 37 spontaneous abortions. In the 47 newborn 2 malformation complications (1 warfarin syndrome, 1 cleft palate) and 4 haemorrhagic complications (without sequelae) were noted. Two fatal thromboses of a mitral prosthesis occurred; systemic embolic complications were noted in 7 cases. These observations suggested different incidences of complications regarding the antithrombotic and anti-embolic prophylaxis. The authors point out the high risk of thrombotic and embolic complications and the low rate of successful outcome of pregnancy in these patients."
6857087,[Language disorders in a right frontal lesion in a right-handed patient. Incoherent speech and extravagant paraphasias. Neuropsychologic study].,"Clinical, neuropsychological, and CT scan data are reported in a patient with a right prefrontal hematoma following meningeal hemorrhage due to the rupture of an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Over a period of six weeks, before and after surgery, the patient presented a particular type of language disorder characterized by incoherent speech, verbal paraphasias, unexpected or guided along ideic perseverations, emphatic and affected terms, and impossibility of brief responses, particularly in denomination tests. Contrasting with the absurdity of the discourse, the respect of oral comprehension, the absence of grammatical disorders, and the perfect phonemic and phonetic organization provided evidence of the integrity of the linguistic code. The purely semantic disturbance, however, was the cause of the apparent alteration in reasoning and judgment. A major amnestic syndrome was also present. It improved concomitantly with the language disorders. The explanation proposed is that of a disturbance of an attention process and of word selection due to a prefrontal lesion."
7423373,"Long-term, continuous intravenous heparin administration by an implantable infusion pump in ambulatory patients with recurrent venous thrombosis.","We studied the effect of long-term intravenous heparin infusion, delivered by a self-recycling, totally implantable infusion pump developed in our laboratory, in 21 patients with recurrent thromboembolic disease. Continuous infusions were maintained in these patients from 1 to 36 months, during which pumps were refilled by percutaneous needle injection at 4- to 8-week intervals. We maintained plasma heparin levels between 0.1 and 0.3 U/ml plasma. This regimen prevented thromboembolic phenomena in all except one patient, who apparently is refractory to heparin as well as oral anticoagulant drug therapy. Marked reduction of pain and improvement of mobility were reported by several patients with vena cava ligature syndrome. No spontaneous hemorrhagic complications occurred; however, several episodes of pump site hemorrhage were associated with pump refills. Bone mineral densities measured in eight subjects after 1 year of heparin infusion [1.00 +/- 0.06 (SE) gm/cm] were not significantly (P = 0.5) different from baseline values (0.98 +/- 0.08 gm/cm); however, osteoporosis did occur in one subject. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and triglycerides also remained unchanged in these subjects. These data suggest that continuous long-term heparin infusion is a viable therapeutic alternative in subjects with refractory thromboembolic disease."
313090,"[Problem of oral surgical interventions during pregnancy, menstruation and under the intake of hormonal contraceptives].","Pregnancy, menstruation and hormonal contraceptives are no contraindications for necessary oral surgical procedures. If the pregnancy takes a normal course, surgical interventions with absolute indication are possible at any time. Surgical interventions with relative indication should be performed during the second trimester of pregnancy. The dental treatment of pregnant women should be terminated, as far as possible, by the 7th or 8th month of pregnancy. Metabolic imbalances, static loading and gingival changes deserve special attention.
Factors involved in performing oral surgery in conjunction with menstruation, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive (o.c.) use are presented. There are very small changes in blood coagulation factors during menstruation, with a longer premenstrual coagulation time. Only necessary major operations should be performed immediately before and during menstruation; extractions and abscess incisions can be performed at any time. Such small operations can also be performed without regard to o.c. use. Serious operations should be performed after the first spontaneous menstruation following discontinuation of o.c. use, due to increased risk of thromboembolism. In cases of emergency operations during o.c. use, a prophylactic against thromboembolic complications should be administered. Most necessary oral surgery can be performed during pregnancy. Where possible, oral surgery should be performed during the second trimester of pregnancy to avoid the possibility of spontaneous abortion in the first trimester and possible metabolic complications in the third trimester. Any operation on a women with eclampsia should be performed in conjunction with a birth attendant. A sitting position is preferred for performing oral surgery on pregnant patients to avoid the possibility of vena cava compression syndrome. An increased tendency of bleeding has not been established among pregnant surgical patients."
452871,The treatment of postmenopausal syndrome by monthly oral doses of quinestrol.,"Seventy patients between the ages of 37 and 59 suffering from the menopausal syndrome were included in a clinical trial and treated for a period of 6 to 18 months. Out of the seventy, 43 were suffering from spontaneous and 27 from surgical menopause. Forty of them were given 1 mg of quinestrol and 30 received placebo. The drug was administered orally in a one-tablet dose once a month. An improvement took place in 35 (87.5%) of the women receiving quinestrol but in only 15 (50%) of those receiving placebo. Among the patients with spontaneous menopause an improvement was seen in 22 out of 25 (88%) receiving quinestrol, compared with 9 out of 18 (50%) receiving placebo. Tolerance of the drug was good and most of the laboratory tests as well as blood pressure and body weight showed statistically non-significant changes. This kind of treatment is expecially suitable when daily intake is undesirable.
Use of small daily doses of quinestrol, a synthetic estrogen consisting of 3 cyclopenthyl-ether of ethinyl estradiol, has been reported to result in remission of postmenopausal symptoms in many patients. This study used quinestrol in 1 mg monthly oral doses in a group of women (N=70) suffering from the menopausal syndrome (43 from spontaneous and 27 from surgical menopause). 40 women received quinestrol 1 mg and 30 were given placebo. Of the 40 who were given quinestrol, 25 had spontaneous menopause and 15 were surgically induced. In the placebo group, 18 had spontaneous menopause and 12 were surgically induced. Treatment lasted from 6-18 months; none of the patients knew whether they had quinestrol or placebo. Blood samples were taken in 10 patients before treatment and 6 months later. As a whole, improvement was observed in 87.5% of the quinestrol-treated group, in contrast to 50% of the placebo-treated group. For women with spontaneous menopause, an improvement was observed in 88% of the quinestrol group and 50% of the placebo group. With respect to the effectiveness of quinestrol, no significant difference in the relief of symptoms was observed between the 2 groups (spontaneous and surgical menopause). Observed side effects were skin rash in 2 patients, thrombophlebitis in 1 patient, vaginal bleeding in 3 patients and nausea in 4 patients. It was concluded that quinestrol therapy is especially suitable in surgical menopause where substitutive therapy is indicated, as well as in cases where daily intake is not favored."
264647,An epilogue to plasma-cell gingivostomatitis (allergic gingivostamtitis).,"Sixteen cases of plasma-cell gingivostomatitis were studied at the University of California San Francisco between 1966 and 1971. Twelve women and four men made up the group, with ages ranging from 15 to 70 years. Prior to treatment, the duration of the disease ranged from 5 to 60 months. Each of the sisteen patients manifested a homogeneous, diffuse, erythematous gingivitis associated with a cheilitis, and fifteen also had a marked glossitis. Each subject was symptomatic, and nine also complained of bleeding. Every biopsy specimen demonstrated a characteristically diffuse and dense plasma-cell infiltrate. There were no spontaneous remissions. Six patients completely responded to systemic corticoids alone, two to discontinuation of gum chewing or the use of their dentifrice, one to antifungal therapy, and the other seven to a combination of the preceding modalities. After completion of therapy, fifteen patients were followed for 2 to 55 months without any evidence of recurrence. Of interest, 69 per cent were gum chewers. The therapeutic benefit of discontinuing gum chewing by itself was not clear. It is assumed that the now nonexistent plasma-cell gingivostomatitis syndrome was a hypersensitivity response to an unidentifiable antigen used in various substances."
797205,[The case for more active prevention of deep-vein thrombosis after major surgery (author's transl)].,"The frequency of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) determined by the 125I-fibrinogen test and confirmed by phlebographic studies, is 20 to 30 % in high-risk patients over the age of forty undergoing major surgery. Comparison of this figure with the incidence of clinically detected thrombosis (5 to 10 %) shows that physical signs are unreliable in the detection of this disease. The ultimate fate of these thrombi is unknown. The majority will probably disappear spontaneously; some will be responsible for the development of a ""post-phlebitic syndrome"" in the extremities and some will propagate and may produce a fatal pulmonary embolus. Besides the currently used physical methods of prophylaxis, some new pharmalogical techniques for the prevention of postoperative deep-vein thrombosis have been tested and advocated in neighbouring countries. Oral anticoagulants have been used routinely for many years by most Dutch surgeons but have never become very popular in other countries. They need extensive laboratory control and, in spite of this, up to 20 % overdosage bleedings have been recorded. As both the administration of low-dose subcutaneous heparin and IV dextran have been reported to provide effective prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis, we decided to study and compare their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial in order to assess their practical value in daily surgical practice. 119 adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery have been investigated. They have been devided at random in three groups : a dextran 40 group (n=39), a heparin group (n=39) and a control group (n=41 patients). DVT was diagnosed by the fibrinogen uptake test in 21,9 % patients in the control group in 12,8 % patients in the dextran group, and in 10,2 % patients in the heparin group. For the highrisk patients over the age of 70, the administration of low dose SC heparin, as well as the administration of IV low molecular weight dextran significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative DVT in the lower extremities (p less than 0.05). The dextran 40 and heparin groups were not significantly different. The techniques are simple and do not need laboratory control. No deleterious side effects have been noted. A large-scale multicentre international, clinical trial (4121 patients) recently showed that low-dose heparin prophylaxis not only lowered the incidence of postoperative deep-vein trombosis without severely augmenting the risk of bleeding, but also significantly reduced the frequency of fatal pulmonary embolism in the postoperative period. It is suggested that the administration of low-dose subcutaneous heparin should become a routine prophylactic measure in daily surgical practice."
1135549,[Akinetic mutism and bicingular softening. 3 anatomo-clinical cases].,"The authors describe three pathological cases of akinetic mutism with, as a common basic lesion, bilateral infarction of the cingulate gyrus secondary to aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (case n degrees 1), to a huge olfactory meningioma (case n degrees 2), both operated on, and to atheromatous occlusion of the anterior cerebral arterial system (case n degrees 3). These three cases enable a variety of ""anterior and waking"" akinetic mutism to be described which is unusual enough to be compared with other mesencephalic and diencephalic aspects of this syndrome. It is in fact an akinetic mutism characterized by: a certain dissociation in its non-response to various stimuli, a particularly marked appearance of wakefulness when day-time alertness is considered, conservation of the waking-sleeping rhythm, perception and reaction unpredictable and paradoxical in both degree and quality, complete absence of any spontaneous verbal communication in contrast to relative break-down of solicited communication which is infrequent, uncertain and unresponsive to the usual methods of stimulation, without any possibility of a code. In addition, there is a remarkable mimic and segmental general akinesia, resistant to the usual nociceptive stimuli, but sensitive to slight excitation of the manual and oral zones. Besides this special akinetic mutism, there are variously systematised signs, mostly asymmetrical, indicating lesion of the cortico-sub-cortical frontal structures bordering on the gyrus cinguli. This unusual behaviour pattern corresponds in these three cases to extensive anterior bilateral ischemic lesions of the cingulate gyrus regularly associated with bilateral infarctions confined to the medial aspect of F1 in the superficial territory of the two anterior cerebral arteries, to possible neurosurgical changes (ablation of the right frontal pole) and to compressive or ischaemic lesions of the gyrus rectus. These exclusively cortico-sub-cortical associated lesions are in contrast with the remarkably intact caudate nuclei, the pallidal, thalamic, hypothalamic and septal formations and the anterior pillars of the fornix. These findings compared with the results of experimental research carried out by M. Kennard, help, if help is needed, to resolve the apparent contradictions between the effects of therapeutic cingulectomies or cingulotomies and the scanty pathological data already available in cerebral vascular pathology."

Early detection of these lesions is further complicated by the overlapping clinical appearance and presentation of lesions associated with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). We report a case of oral squamous cell carcinoma in a 33 year-old man who presented with severe intraoral pain on the lower left side of the cheek and jaw 19 months after undergoing HSCT for the treatment of underlying acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. He was previously treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen for HSCT and later developed cGVHD of the liver, eyes, and gut, which resolved with treatment. Intraoral examination revealed two separate lesions. The first lesion presented as a raised oval nodular swelling with a well-circumscribed margin and irregular surface on the left buccal mucosa. A similar, but more extensive, lesion was noted on the left lingual gingiva and was associated with spontaneous bleeding. Biopsy revealed that both lesions were well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas and were p16 positive. He underwent palliative radiotherapy but succumbed to his disease 3 months after initiation of treatment.

32575613,Oral Manifestations and Complications in Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of diseases, whose classification is based on lineage-commitment and genetics. Although rare in childhood, it is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults, accounting for 80% of all cases in this age group. The prognosis of this disease remains poor (especially in childhood, as compared to acute lymphoblastic leukemia); however, overall survival has significantly improved over the past 30 years. The health of the oral cavity is a remarkable reflection of the systemic status of an individual. Identification of the signs and symptoms of oral lesions can act as a warning sign of hidden and serious systemic involvement. Moreover, they may be the presenting feature of acute leukemia and provide important diagnostic indicators. Primary oral alterations are identified in up to 90% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia and consist of petechiae, spontaneous bleeding, mucosal ulceration, gingival enlargement with or without necrosis, infections, hemorrhagic bullae on the tongue, and cracked lips. Poor oral hygiene is a well-known risk factor for local and systemic infectious complications. Oro-dental complications due to AML treatment can affect the teeth, oral mucosa, soft and bone tissue, and contribute to opportunistic infections, dental decay, and enamel discoloration. The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. The management is multimodal, involving aggressive multidrug chemotherapy and, in most cases, allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Periodontal and dental treatment for patients with leukemia should always be planned and concerted with hematologists."
25721286,Oral manifestations as an early clinical sign of acute myeloid leukaemia: a case report.,"Leukaemia is the most common malignancy in children and one of the most common malignancies in young adults. Acute myeloid leukaemia is often associated with early oral manifestations. The purpose of this study is to report the case of a 49-year-old male with spontaneous gingival bleeding for over two years with undiagnosed leukaemia. Haematological investigation was instigated and on referral to the Haematology Department at Dunedin Public Hospital, the diagnosis of an acute myeloid leukaemia was confirmed. Since oral lesions can be one of the early events of acute myeloid leukaemia, they may be considered as an important diagnostic indicator for oral health practitioners, and their roles in diagnosing and treating such patients."
24610293,Spontaneous remission in acute myeloid leukemia: A Case Report.,"Spontaneous remission of Acute Myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an uncommon event, temporary and its mechanism is yet to be determined. We report here a case of spontaneous remission of AML in a 35 years old male who was diagnosed with AML (M4) in Jan 2011. He presented very ill with fever, bleeding tendency and oral candidacies. He received supportive care only and chemotherapy was withheld. His general condition improved and fever subsided. White blood cell (WBC) count started to drop spontaneously and gradually until he became leukopenic and developed febrile neutropenia. After the second recovery, his full blood count (FBC) and bone marrow examination showed haematological remission. He was followed up for six weeks after which relapse occurred. Chemotherapy was started immediately, but unfortunately was not continued because of sepsis. The patient died four weeks after relapse. Other reports on the spontaneous remission of AML showed a similar temporary period of remission with different duration, and then followed by relapse. Possible mechanisms of spontaneous remission in AML are discussed with a review of the literature.

23632949,Post-transplant gastric antral vascular ectasia after intra-venous busulfan regimen.,"Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is an angiodysplastic disorder that causes gastric bleeding. GAVE can develop as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT-GAVE), and it has been suggested that it may be associated with oral administration of busulfan. We report two cases of HSCT-GAVE after a conditioning regimen containing intra-venous busulfan (ivBu), not oral busulfan. The first case, a 42-year-old woman with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, underwent second allogeneic HSCT with conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and ivBu (12.8 mg/kg). HSCT-GAVE developed on day 84 post-transplant, and argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed successfully. The second case, a 60-year-old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia, underwent allogeneic HSCT with the conditioning regimen consisting of ivBu (12.8 mg/kg) and fludarabine (150 mg/kg). She developed melena and was diagnosed with GAVE by endoscopy on day 145 post-transplant. Although complete hemostasis was not achieved despite four administrations of APCs, the melena spontaneously terminated on day 235 post-transplant. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing HSCT-GAVE after ivBU-based HSCT. Although there is no established therapy for HSCT-GAVE, APC may be an option for HSCT-GAVE."
23122838,[Massive bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage revealing acute lymphoblastic leukemia].,"We report the case of 20-year-old patient who presented in emergency with bilateral massive, spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage. Clinical findings suggested a blood dyscrasia, which was confirmed by blood cell count. The patient was urgently referred to hematology where the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was made. This case highlights the importance of working up any unusual subconjunctival hemorrhage, as it may reveal, in certain cases, a severe life-threatening disease."
22972688,Case of pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia presenting as extramedullary tumor of the mandible.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a malignant subtype of acute myeloid leukemia caused by the PML-retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α fusion gene. APL may be discovered in adulthood and diagnosed after spontaneous gingival bleeding or difficulty in hemostasis after oral surgery such as tooth extraction. However, APL is extremely rare in children.
A 1-year-old boy presented with a mass on the mentum of the mandible. The marked periosteal reaction was seen on CT and MRI, leading to strong suspicion of a malignant bone-derived tumor such as a sarcoma. Chromosome banding by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed PML-RARα, confirming the diagnosis of APL. Treatment with tretinoin was immediately initiated. No signs of recurrence have been noted 1 year after treatment.
We report herein a rare case involving an infant with APL who presented with an extramedullary tumor of the mandible, whom we treated with good results."
15835428,Oral manifestations during chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a case report.,"A 14-year-old, male patient was referred for the treatment of mucositis, idiopathic facial asymmetry, and candidiasis. The patient had been undergoing chemotherapy for 5 years for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He presented with a swollen face, fever, and generalized symptomatology in the mouth with burning. On physical examination, general signs of poor health, paleness, malnutrition, and jaundice were observed. The extraoral clinical examination showed edema on the right side of the face and cutaneous erythema. On intraoral clinical examination, generalized ulcers with extensive necrosis on the hard palate mucosa were observed, extending to the posterior region. Both free and attached gingivae were ulcerated and edematous with exudation and spontaneous bleeding, mainly in the superior and inferior anterior teeth region. The tongue had no papillae and was coated, due to poor oral hygiene. The patient also presented with carious white lesions and enamel hypoplasia, mouth opening limitation, and foul odor. After exfoliative cytology of the affected areas, the diagnosis was mixed infection by Candida albicans and bacteria. Recommended treatment was antibiotics and antifungal administration, periodontal prophylaxis, topical application of fluor 1.23%, and orientation on and control of proper oral hygiene and diet during the remission phase of the disease."

The mutation has a wide range of clinical presentations involving neurological, immunological, and hematological manifestations. Until now, limited data regarding different variants of this genetic mutation existed. Here we present a 6-year-old girl who presented with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic changes and who carries a new germline variant mutation in the SAMD9L gene.
A 6-year-old girl who presented initially as a case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was later diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic changes. In addition, she was found to have a new germline variant mutation in the SAMD9L gene (other known pathogenic variants known to cause ataxia pancytopenia syndrome). She was treated with chemotherapy followed by haplo identical transplant from her unaffected father. She is alive 30 months post-transplant and in complete remission with full donor chimerism. Her initial brain MRI showed mild prominence of the anterior (superior) vermis folia, suggesting mild atrophy. Ongoing surveillance for accompanied neurological manifestation is ongoing, although the patient is asymptomatic.
For SAMD-9L-related disorder, a careful approach must be taken when a patient presents with a suspicious clinical feature even without a well-known genetic mutation giving the diverse presentation across affected members within the same family. In addition, other associated abnormalities should be monitored long-term."

36863912,Caplacizumab as rescue therapy in refractory TTP involving neurologic features.,"The role of caplacizumab in the routine treatment of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) remains to be established.
A 56-year-old woman was transferred to our center with iTTP and neurologic features. At the outside hospital, she was initially diagnosed and managed as Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Upon transfer to our center, daily plasma exchange, steroids, and rituximab were initiated. After an initial improvement, refractoriness became evident with a decline in platelet count and continued neurologic abnormalities. Initiation of caplacizumab resulted in rapid hematologic and clinical responses.
Caplacizumab is a valuable treatment modality in iTTP, particularly in cases associated with refractoriness or neurologic features."
36861115,Distinguishing immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura from septic disseminated intravascular coagulation using plasma levels of haptoglobin and factor XIII activity.,"Both immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) and septic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are life-threatening disorders developed by platelet-consuming microvascular thrombi and necessitate immediate therapeutic interventions. Although severe deficiencies of plasma haptoglobin in iTTP and factor XIII (FXIII) activity in septic DIC have been reported, few studies have focused on the possibility of using these markers to distinguish between iTTP and septic DIC.
We investigated whether the plasma levels of haptoglobin and FXIII activity could be helpful for differential diagnosis.
Thirty-five patients with iTTP and 30 with septic DIC were enrolled in the study. Patient characteristics, coagulation, and fibrinolytic markers were collected from the clinical data. Plasma haptoglobin and FXIII activities were measured using chromogenic Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay and an automated instrument, respectively.
The median plasma haptoglobin level was 0.39 mg/dL and 54.20 mg/dL in the iTTP and septic DIC groups, respectively. The median plasma FXIII activities were 91.3% and 36.3% in the iTTP and septic DIC groups, respectively. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cutoff level of plasma haptoglobin was 2.868 mg/dL and the area under the curve was 0.832. The cutoff level for plasma FXIII activity and the area under the curve were 76.0% and 0.931, respectively. The thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/DIC index was defined by FXIII activity (percentage) and haptoglobin (milligrams per decilitre). Laboratory TTP was defined as an index ≥60 and laboratory DIC <60. The sensitivity and specificity of the TTP/DIC index were 94.3% and 86.7%, respectively.
The TTP/DIC index, composed of plasma levels of haptoglobin and FXIII activity, is useful in differentiating iTTP from septic DIC."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is frequently associated with ITP. In some cases, thrombocytopenia in SLE patients is attributed to concurrent antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA). Currently, data regarding treatment with TPO-R agonists for ITP in SLE or APLA patients are limited. The incidence of SLE flare or antiphospholipid syndrome while on TPO-R agonists has not been well-studied.
We report 2 cases of female patients with SLE and concurrent triple positive APLA, without thrombotic events in their medical history, in our rheumatology clinic, who were treated for refractory ITP with eltrombopag. Both developed catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome a few weeks after beginning treatment with eltrombopag. They were admitted to the intensive care unit and treated with solumedrol, plasmapheresis, anticoagulation and rituximab.
We describe a severe possible side-effect of eltrombopag as a trigger of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, a rare initial manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome, in SLE patients with APLA. We suggest that APLA should be tested before initiating eltrombopag in patients with SLE-associated ITP. The safety of this treatment should be considered in these cases."
36818771,Effect of Blood Groups on Clinical Presentations and Treatment Outcomes in Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Patients with Severe ADAMTS13 Deficiency: A Multi-Center Experience.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (vWF) due to the significantly reduced activity ADAMTS13. Limited studies have been published examining the blood group as an epidemiological factor that can contribute to development of TTP. It has been suggested that due to low vWF levels, the distribution of the ""O"" blood group among TTP patients may be lower than anticipated compared to the blood group distribution rates in the normal population. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between blood groups and the clinical outcome of immune TTP (iTTP).
Thirty patients with iTTP with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency were enrolled. Data collection commenced in January 2011 and was completed by June 2020. It was analyzed whether there was a difference between the blood groups in terms of frequency of iTTP, response to treatment, frequency of relapse, and clinical and laboratory results.
The distribution of group ""A"" among patients with iTTP was higher than expected. Although not statistically significant, patients with blood group ""O"" required more TPE for the treatment and relapse rate was statistically higher than other blood groups. Mortality rate in all patients was 6.7%. Although blood group ""A"" is a risk factor for iTTP, the frequency of relapse is higher in the blood group ""O."""
36817307,Hepatitis of an Unknown Etiology with Concomitant ITP.,"Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) usually presents after decades of alcohol consumption and can even manifest with recent abstinence. The clinical presentation may be compounded by underlying liver cirrhosis and liver function enzymes are not a reliable means of diagnosing AH due to poor sensitivity and specificity. One feature of alcoholic hepatitis is thrombocytopenia; however, patients may also have thrombocytopenia due to another underlying condition, such as Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). ITP is an autoimmune disease caused by autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion and secondary causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out with persistent thrombocytopenia that is refractory to treatment for AH. Although there is limited data demonstrating a correlation between AH and ITP, both conditions respond to steroids. We present a case of a 42 YO M with an unknown cause of hepatitis and concomitant ITP who responded well to steroids."
36813118,Autoantibodies enhance ADAMTS13 clearance in patients with immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Severe deficiency in ADAMTS13 (<10%) and the loss of von Willebrand factor-cleaving function can precipitate the microvascular thrombosis associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) patients have anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies that inhibit ADAMTS13 function and/or increase ADAMTS13 clearance. iTTP patients are treated primarily by plasma exchange (PEX), often in combination with adjunct therapies that target either the VWF-dependent microvascular thrombotic processes (caplacizumab) or the autoimmune components (steroids/rituximab) of the disease.
To investigate the contributions of autoantibody-mediated ADAMTS13 clearance and inhibition in iTTP patients at presentation and through the course of PEX therapy.
Anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies, ADAMTS13 antigen and activity were measured before and after each PEX in 17 iTTP patients and 20 acute TTP episodes.
At presentation, 14/15 iTTP patients had ADAMTS13 antigen levels <10% suggesting a major contribution of ADAMTS13 clearance to the deficiency state. After the first PEX, both ADAMTS13 antigen and activity levels increased similarly, and anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody titre decreased in all patients, revealing ADAMTS13 inhibition to be a modest modifier of ADAMTS13 function in iTTP. Analysis of ADAMTS13 antigen levels between consecutive PEX treatments revealed that the rate of ADAMTS13 clearance in 9/14 patients analysed was 4- to 10-fold faster the estimated normal rate of clearance.
These data reveal, both at presentation and during PEX treatment, that antibody-mediated clearance of ADAMTS13 is the major pathogenic mechanism causing ADAMTS13 deficiency in iTTP. Understanding the kinetics of ADAMTS13 clearance in iTTP may now enable further optimisation of iTTP patient treatment."

Among 5373 registered patients, 9 Iranian patients (33.3% female) with confirmed DCLRE1C mutation were identified since 1999-2022. The demographic, clinical, immunological and genetic features were collected through retrospective investigation of medical records and using next generation sequencing.
Seven patients were born in a consanguineous family (77.8%). The median age of onset was 6.0 (5.0-17.0) months. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) was clinically detected at a median (IQR) age of 7.0 (6.0-20.5) months, following a median diagnostic delay of 2.0 (1.0-3.5) months The most typical first presentation was pneumonia (44.4%) and otitis media (3.33%), followed by BCG lymphadenitis (22.2%) and gastroenteritis (11.1%). The most prevalent manifestations were respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) (66.6%) and chronic diarrhea (66.6%). In addition, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (P5) and celiac disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (P9) as autoimmune disorders were reported in 2 patients. All patients had reduced B CD19+ and CD4+ cell counts. IgA deficiency occurred in 77.8% of individuals.
Recurrent infections particulary respiratory tract infection and chronic diarrhea during the first months of life in patients born to consanguineous parents should raise the suspicion for inborn errors of immunity, even in the presence of normal growth and development."
36807823,Diagnostic Performance of a Particle Gel Immunoassay in Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious complication of adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. Similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), antibodies reacting to platelet factor 4 (PF4) are responsible for platelet activation in VITT. The diagnosis of VITT includes the detection of anti-PF4 antibodies. Particle gel immunoassay (PaGIA) is one of the rapid immunoassays that is commonly used in the diagnosis of HIT to detect anti-PF4 antibodies. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of PaGIA in patients suspected of VITT. In this retrospective, single-center study, the correlation between PaGIA, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and modified heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay (HIPA) in patients with findings suggestive of VITT was investigated. A commercially available PF4 rapid immunoassay (ID PaGIA H/PF4, Bio-Rad-DiaMed GmbH, Switzerland) and an anti-PF4/heparin EIA (ZYMUTEST HIA IgG, Hyphen Biomed) were used according to manufacturer's instructions. Modified HIPA was accepted as the gold standard test. Between March 8 and November 19, 2021, a total of 34 samples from clinically well-characterized patients (14 males, 20 females, mean age: 48.2 ± 18.2 years) were analyzed with PaGIA, EIA, and modified HIPA. VITT was diagnosed in 15 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of PaGIA were 54 and 67%, respectively. Anti-PF4/heparin optical density values were not significantly different between PaGIA positive and negative samples ("
36800613,Microsurgical complication associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT): A case report.,"The use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Astra Zeneca) vaccine has proven beneficial, but in a limited number of the general population, it was found to be associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). However, there have been no reports of this complication occurring in a microsurgical free tissue transfer.
A 49-year-old man developed an acute myocardial infarction 3 weeks after receiving his first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in June 2021. Three months later, he presented with right third toe wet gangrene with extension into the plantar foot nine days after receiving his second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.
Based on recent exposure to vaccination, the timing of inoculation before the development of his symptoms, and serology tests (platelet, D-dimer, and anti-PF4 antibodies), the patient was diagnosed with VITT.
Fasciectomy and sequestrectomy were performed for wound bed preparation. Limb salvage was done using free vastus lateralis muscle flap and skin graft for reconstruction.
The flap was complicated by persistent microthrombi leading to superficial necrosis without vascular pedicle compromise. Repeated debridement of the superficial necrosis was done. Three months after the development of VITT, no further new superficial necrosis was seen. A well-contoured flap was seen 5 months after the initial surgery.
We believe this is the first case describing microthrombi in the free flap due to VITT after microsurgical reconstruction. Patients and surgeons should be advised of this possible risk when contemplating microsurgery once VITT has developed after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administration."
36800582,Gene mutations in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were related to immune thrombocytopenia pathogenesis.,"Immune thrombocytopenic (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disease with genetic susceptibility. Twenty newly diagnosed active primary ITP patients who had not been treated with glucocorticosteroids, immune globulin or immunosuppressants prior to sampling were enrolled in this study. Bone marrow blood mononuclear cells were used for whole exome sequencing to further elucidation the variant genes of ITP.
High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted from freshly frozen bone marrow blood mononuclear cells from 20 active ITP patients. Next, the samples were subjected to molecular genetic analysis by whole-exome sequencing, and the results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The signaling pathways and cellular processes associated with the mutated genes were identified with gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses.
The results showed that there were 3998 missense mutations involving 2269 genes in more than 10 individuals. Unique genetic variants including phosphatase and tensin homolog, insulin receptor, and coagulation factor C homology were the most associated with the pathogenesis of ITP. Functional analysis revealed these mutation genes mainly affect Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/serine/threonine kinase B signaling pathways (signal transduction) and platelet activation (immune system).
Our finding further demonstrates the functional connections between these variant genes and ITP. Although the substantial mechanism and the impact of genetic variation are required further investigation, the application of next generation sequencing in ITP in this paper is a valuable method to reveal the genetic susceptibility."
36799363,The association between platelet glycoprotein-specific antibodies and response to short-term high-dose dexamethasone with prednisone maintenance treatment in adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia.,"The aim of the present study was to detect the association between platelet glycoprotein-specific autoantibodies and the patient response to short-term high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM) + prednisone maintenance treatment.
The data from 112 adult patients newly diagnosed with ITP who were administered first-line HD-DXM + prednisone maintenance therapy between January 2016 and January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed.
A total of 72 patients positive for platelet glycoprotein-specific antibodies were enrolled in the antibody-positive group, and 40 patients not positive for platelet glycoprotein-specific antibodies were enrolled in the antibody-negative group. In the antibody-positive group, six platelet glycoprotein-specific antibody types were found: 41.67% of the patients were anti-GP IIb/IIIa-positive only, 5.56% were anti-GP Ib/IX-positive only, 5.56% were anti-P-selectin-positive only, 19.44% were anti-GP IIb/IIIa- and anti-GP Ib/IX-positive, 16.67% were anti-GP Ib/IX- and P-selectin-positive and 11.11% were positive for all three antibodies. There was no significant difference in the overall response rate between the antibody-positive group and the antibody-negative group (94.44 versus 80.00%, 
The present study discovered that adult patients newly diagnosed with ITP who had positive platelet glycoprotein-specific antibody test results were likely to achieve a better response after treatment with HD-DXM + prednisone maintenance."

The patient underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism. Eltrombopag was stopped on discharge, considering the potential cause of venous thrombosis."
36781038,Development of systemic lupus erythematosus in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura: A systematic meta-analysis.,"Recent population-based cohort studies suggest that the incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is increased in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the development of SLE in patients with ITP.
Literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for studies published prior to October 2022. Studies were included that reported development of SLE in ITP patients. Forest plot was used to detect overall SLE frequency in ITP and compare risk ratios for SLE development in different ITP subgroups. Study heterogeneity was assessed by using I
26 eligible studies comprising 14867 ITP patients were included in analysis. 311 ITP patients developed SLE during the follow-up period (range: 1.1-14 years) (2.09%, 95%CI: 1.87-2.33). Relative risk (RR) for developing SLE was significantly higher in female ITP patients (RR: 4.23, 95%CI: 2.52-7.12, p < 0.0001). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was reported in 23 studies, there were 766/4377 ANA positive patients with ITP (17.5%). The risk of SLE development in ANA positive ITP patients was significant (RR: 26.29, 95%CI: 14.45-47.81, p < 0.0001).
Our study suggests ITP patients are at high risk of developing SLE in future. Pooled data revealed that females and patients with a positive ANA titer are at a significantly high risk of developing SLE."
36779528,A case of systemic lupus erythematosus having concurrent Evans syndrome and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"An 18-year-old Japanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experienced dyspnoea, headache, tinnitus, and purpura for two weeks and was admitted to our hospital. The patient had been diagnosed with SLE and secondary immune thrombocytopenia eight years before and treated with high-dose prednisolone (PSL) and mycophenolate mofetil. Since the blood test on admission showed haemolytic anaemia with a positive direct Coombs test and anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibodies, the patient was initially diagnosed with Evans syndrome (ES). The patient was treated with pulse intravenous methylprednisolone followed by 45 mg/day prednisolone; however, the patient's platelet count did not normalise. Based on a low level of a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13 (ADAMTS-13) activity and a high level of ADAMTS-13 inhibitors, a diagnosis of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was confirmed. After undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange for six consecutive days, the patient's platelet count recovered rapidly. Although concurrent acquired TTP and ES have not been reported previously, the findings from this case highlight the importance of measuring ADAMTS-13 activity and inhibitors to rule out acquired TTP, especially when ES is refractory to glucocorticoids."

36757521,Frontiers in pathophysiology and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a fatal disease in which platelet-rich microthrombi cause end-organ ischemia and damage. TTP is caused by markedly reduced ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity. Hereditary or congenital TTP (cTTP) is caused by ADAMTS13 gene mutations. In acquired or immune TTP (iTTP), ADAMTS13 activity is reduced by anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, fever, renal dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and immunosuppressive therapy are the mainstays of treatment. As untreated TTP has a high mortality rate, immediate initiation of TPE is recommended when TTP is suspected. Conventionally, corticosteroids have been used for immunosuppressive therapy. Current drug therapies include rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody that is effective in newly diagnosed cases and refractory cases, as well as for relapse prevention, and caplacizumab, an anti- von Willebrand factor (VWF) nanobody that inhibits the binding of platelets to VWF and prevents microthrombi formation. Recombinant human ADAMTS13 is a promising treatment for cTTP. Although these therapeutic advances have improved the outcomes of TTP, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy are necessary to achieve these outcomes."
36756916,Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: clinical suspicion and basic management in emergency departments - an expert review and consensus statement from the Spanish societies of hematology and hemotherapy (SEHH) and emergency medicine (SEMES).,"Acquired or immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are thrombotic microangiopathies associated with high mortality if treatment is not started early. Onset is usually sudden, meaning that the condition is often diagnosed in hospital emergency departments, where TTP must be suspected as early as possible. These guidelines were drafted by specialists in emergency medicine and hematology to cover the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of patients suspected of immune-mediated TTP who require emergency care. Immune TTP should be suspected whenever a patient presents with hemolytic microangiopathy and has a negative Coombs test, and thrombocytopenia, possibly in conjunction with fever and neurologic and cardiac alterations. If one of the existing diagnostic algorithms indicates there is a high probability that the patient has immune TTP, plasma exchange therapy should be started along with immunosuppressants. Treatment with caplacizumab should also be considered. The patient should be referred immediately to the hematology department within the same hospital or a referral hospital.
La púrpura trombótica trombocitopénica adquirida o inmune (PTTi) es una microangiopatía trombótica (MAT) con una elevada mortalidad si no se instaura un tratamiento precoz. El inicio habitualmente brusco de la enfermedad hace que, en la mayoría de los pacientes, el diagnóstico inicial se haga en los servicios de urgencias hospitalarios (SUH), donde se debe sospechar esta entidad con la mayor inmediatez posible. Esta guía, elaborada por profesionales de Medicina de Urgencias y de Hematología, establece unas recomendaciones en cuanto al diagnóstico, derivación y tratamiento de los pacientes con sospecha de PTTi en los SUH. Se debe sospechar PTTi en todo paciente que presente una anemia hemolítica microangiopática, prueba de Coombs directo negativa y trombocitopenia pudiendo asociar, además, fiebre, alteraciones neurológicas y cardiacas. Si tras la aplicación de alguno de los algoritmos diagnósticos existentes, hay una alta probabilidad de que el paciente presente una PTTi, debería iniciarse tratamiento con recambio plasmático, inmunosupresores y valorar el inicio de caplacizumab. Además, debe gestionarse el traslado inmediato de los pacientes al Servicio de Hematología, bien del mismo centro o a uno de referencia."
36755235,Eradication therapy may decrease the risk of immune thrombocytopenia after Helicobacter pylori infection: a retrospective cohort study in Taiwan.,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication therapy (HPE) is recommended for patients with unexplained immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); however, the role of HPE in preventing ITP in patients with HP infection remains unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to clarify it.
This study was conducted at a tertiary medical center and included all adult patients with HP infection between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. We compared the risk of developing ITP between patients with and without HPE. All patients were followed up until December 31, 2020.
After excluding patients with thrombocytopenia, 1995 adult patients with HP infection, including 1188 patients with HPE and 807 patients without HPE, were included in this study. The mean age of the patients with HPE was 57.9 years, whereas that of those without HPE was 61.6 years. The percentage of males was 56% in patients with HPE and 59% in those without HPE. Patients without HPE had a higher risk of ITP than those with HPE after adjusting for age, sex, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and comorbidities [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.68]. Stratified analyses showed that the higher risk was found only in males (adjusted OR: 1.70; 95% CI 1.03-2.80). In addition to HPE, male sex and anemia were independent predictors of ITP in patients with HP infection.
This study showed that adult patients with HP infection not receiving HPE had a higher risk of developing ITP. We suggest that HPE should be considered, particularly in males and those who have anemia, to prevent ITP."
36750960,Concurrence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a case report and review of the literature.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are both causes of thrombocytopenia. Recognizing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is crucial for subsequent treatment and prognosis. In clinical practice, corticosteroids and rituximab can be used to treat both immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; plasma exchange therapy is the first-line treatment in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, while corticosteroids are strongly recommended as first-line treatment in immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The differential diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is essential in clinical practice. However, case reports have suggested that immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can occur concurrently.
We report the case of a 32-year-old Asian female without previous disease who presented with pancytopenia, concurrent with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The morphology of the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow indicated immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. The patient received glucocorticoid treatment, and her platelet count increased; however, schistocytes remained high during the course of the therapy. Further investigations revealed ADAMTS13 activity deficiency and positive ADAMTS13 antibodies. The high titer of antinuclear antibody and positive anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein/Smith antibody indicated a potential autoimmune disease. However, the patient did not fulfill the current criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease. The patient responded well to plasma exchange therapy, and her platelet count remained normal on further follow-up.
Concurrence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is rare, but clinicians should be aware of this entity to ensure prompt medical intervention. Most of the reported cases involve young women. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, pregnancy, and autoimmune disease are the most common underlying conditions."
36750876,Research on the mechanism of prednisone in the treatment of ITP via VIP/PACAP-mediated intestinal immune dysfunction.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is thought to be a result of immune dysfunction, which is treated by glucocorticoids such as prednisone. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) have immunomodulatory properties, but their role in intestinal immune control is unclear. The major goal of this study was to look at the effects of prednisone on platelet, VIP, and PACAP levels in ITP mice, as well as the regulatory system that controls intestinal immunity.
Eighteen BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups: blank control group, model control group, and prednisone group, with six mice in each group. The ITP animal model control group and the prednisone group were injected with anti-platelet serum (APS) to replicate the ITP animal model. The prednisone group began prednisone intervention on the 8th day. Platelet count was dynamically measured before APS injection, on the 4th day of injection, on the 1st day of administration, on the 4th day of administration, and at the end of the experiment. After the experiment, the expression of p53 protein in mouse mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes was detected by immunohistochemistry. The changes in lymphocyte apoptosis rate in mouse mesenteric lymph nodes were detected by in situ terminal transferase labeling (TUNEL). The contents of VIP and PACAP in the mouse brain, colon, and serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The contents of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A in the mouse spleen were detected by ELISA.
①Changes of peripheral platelet count: there was no significant difference in platelet count among the three groups before modeling; on the 4th day, the platelet count decreased in the model control group and prednisone group; on the 8th day, the number of platelets in model control group and prednisone group was at the lowest level; on the 12th day, the platelet count in prednisone group recovered significantly; on the 15th day, the platelet count in prednisone group continued to rise. ②Changes of VIP, PACAP: compared with the blank control group, VIP and PACAP in the model control group decreased significantly in the brain, colon, and serum. Compared with the model control group, the levels of VIP and PACAP in the brain, colon, and serum in the prednisone group were increased except for serum PACAP. ③Changes of mesenteric lymphocytes: the expression of p53 protein in the mesenteric lymph nodes of model control group mice was significantly higher than that of blank control group mice. After prednisone intervention, the expression of p53 protein decreased significantly.④Changes of cytokines in spleen: compared with blank control group, IFN- γ, IL-17A increased and IL-4 and IL-10 decreased in model control group. After prednisone intervention, IFN- γ, IL-17A was down-regulated and IL-4 and IL-10 were upregulated.
Prednisone-upregulated VIP and PACAP levels decreased P53 protein expression and apoptosis rate in mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes and affected cytokine expression in ITP model mice. Therefore, we speculate that the regulation of intestinal immune function may be a potential mechanism of prednisone in treating ITP."
36749015,Is Satoyoshi syndrome an autoimmune disease? A systematic review.,"Satoyoshi syndrome (SS) is a rare multisystem disease of presumed autoimmunea aetiology. We carried out a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence to support that autoimmune hypothesis.
We searched for SS cases in PubMed, the Web of Knowledge and Scopus up to January 2022, using keywords ""Satoyoshi syndrome"" or ""Komuragaeri disease"". Data on symptoms, associated autoimmune diseases, presence of autoantibodies and response to treatment were collected.
77 patients from 57 articles published between 1967 and 2021 were included. 59 patients were women. The mean age at diagnosis was 21.2 years. All cases had painful muscular spasms and alopecia. Frequent manifestations included: diarrhoea, malabsorption, growth retardation, amenorrhea and bone deformity. SS was associated with other autoimmune diseases: myasthenia gravis, autoimmune thyroiditis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, atopic dermatitis, bronchial and lupus erythematosus. Autoantibody determinations were performed in 39 patients, of which 27 had positive results. The most frequently detected autoantibodies were antinuclear antibodies. Other less frequently found auto-antibodies were: anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, antithyroid antibodies, anti-GAD and anti-gliadin antibodies. Pharmacological treatment was reported in 50 patients. Most of them improved with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and immunoglobulins, or a combination of these medications.
SS is associated with other autoimmune diseases and a variety of autoantibodies. Improvement after corticosteroid or other immunosuppressant treatment was observed in 90% of cases. These data support an autoimmune aetiology for SS. More studies including systematic determination of autoantibodies in all patients with SS will help us advance in our understanding of this disease."
36746879,Evans' syndrome induced by atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.,"An 86-year-old man presented with recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was initiated. After the third course of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy, petechial purpura appeared on the extremities and trunk. Laboratory tests revealed isolated severe thrombocytopenia without evidence of combined coagulopathy. He was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and high-dose immunoglobulin and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies were administered. Improvement in thrombocytopenia was observed; however, 20 days after the onset of ITP, laboratory data revealed hemolytic anemia. Both direct and indirect Coombs tests were positive, and he was diagnosed with Evan's syndrome complicated by ITP and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) induced by immune-related adverse events (irAEs). After treatment with prednisolone, the hemoglobin level increased, and hemolytic findings improved on blood tests. We encountered a rare case of Evans' syndrome due to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy for HCC. In atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy, hematologic toxicities are not rare adverse events and attention is required."

He consulted to our hospital for further examination. Computed tomography (CT) showed multiple cysts in the liver and kidney and also showed cystic lesions in the pancreatic tail. The size of the tumor of pancreas was 3 cm × 4 cm. FDG-PET CT showed FDG uptake in the tumor of the pancreatic tail. It has not showed metastasis in the other organs.

36738663,Platelet function and soluble P-selectin in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia.,"The bleeding phenotype in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is heterogeneous, but usually mild and only partly dependent on the severity of thrombocytopenia. Platelet reactivity has previously been suggested to underly the mild phenotype.
Platelet function was assessed as basal and agonist-induced surface expression of P-selectin and activation of GPIIb/IIIa via flow cytometry, and soluble (s)P-selectin levels were assessed in plasma of 77 patients with primary ITP, 19 hemato-oncologic thrombocytopenic controls (TC) and 20 healthy controls (HC). The association of platelet function with laboratory and clinical parameters such as bleeding manifestations at inclusion and previous thrombosis was analyzed.
ITP patients showed tendency towards increased surface P-selectin and elevated levels of activated GPIIb/IIIa. Platelet activation after stimulation with all agonists including TRAP-6, ADP, arachidonic acid and CRP was decreased compared to HC. Compared to TC, only GPIIb/IIIa activation but not surface P-selectin was higher in ITP. Levels of soluble (s)P-selectin were significantly higher in ITP patients compared to TC, but similar to HC. Higher sP-selectin levels were associated with blood group O and current therapy, with highest levels in TPO-RA treated patients. Platelet reactivity was not associated with platelet count or size, platelet antibodies, treatment regime, or blood group. No correlation between platelet activation with the bleeding phenotype or previous thrombotic events could be observed.
ITP patients did not have hyper-reactive platelets compared to HC, but partly higher reactivity compared to TC. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanism behind the bleeding and pro-thrombotic phenotype in ITP. 250/250."
36726813,Older Adults and Immune Thrombocytopenia: Considerations for the Clinician.,"Many epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) increases after age 60 years and peaks in patients over age 80 years. Therefore, ITP is a concern for physicians taking care of older patients, especially regarding its diagnosis and management. The diagnostic work-up should exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia and secondary ITP, including myelodysplastic syndrome and drug-induced ITP. The treatment decision is influenced by an increased risk of bleeding, infectious diseases and thrombosis in this population and should take into account comorbidities and concomitant medications such as anticoagulant drugs. First-line treatment is based on short corticosteroids courses and intravenous immunoglobulin, which should be reserved for patients with more severe bleeding complications, with their higher risk of toxic effects as compared with younger patients. Second-line treatment should be tailored to the patient's history, comorbidities and preferences. Preferred second-line treatments are thrombopoietin receptor agonists for most groups and guidelines given their good efficacy/tolerance ratio, but the thrombotic risk is increased in older people. Other second-line options that can be good alternatives depending on the clinical context include rituximab, dapsone, fostamatinib or immunosuppressive drugs. Splenectomy is less often performed but remains an option for fit patients with chronic refractory disease. Emerging treatments such as Syk or Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and FcRn antagonists are becoming available for ITP and may modify the treatment algorithm in the near future. The aim of this review is to describe the particularities of the diagnosis and treatment of ITP in older people, including the response and tolerance to the currently available drugs. We also discuss some situations related to co-morbidities that can frequently lead to adapt the management strategy in older patients."
36722595,Acute acquired immune thrombocytopenia after cardiac surgery: A challenging case.,"Thrombocytopenia is a common condition that recognizes an infinite number of possible causes, especially in specific settings like the one covered in this case report: the postoperative period of cardiac surgery. We report a case of an old male with multiple comorbidities who underwent a coronary angioplasty procedure and aortic valve replacement. He showed severe thrombocytopenia in the postoperative days. Differential diagnosis required a big effort, also for the experts in the field. Our goal was to aggressively treat the patient with prednisolone, platelets, and intravenous immunoglobulins to maximize the prognosis. Our patient developed no complications and was discharged successfully."
36720103,Delayed normalisation of ADAMTS13 activity in acute Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura in the caplacizumab era.,"The benefits of caplacizumab in acute immune mediated TTP (iTTP) are well established. We identified a delay in normalisation of ADAMTS13 activity (>30%) in a subgroup of caplacizumab treated patients which was not evident in the pre-caplacizumab era. Caplacizumab treated patients (n=64) achieved ADAMTS13 activity >30% at median 31 days post PEX, compared to 11.5 days in the non-caplacizumab group (n=50, p=0.0004). 18/64 (28%) caplacizumab treated patients had an ADAMTS13 activity <10% at the time of stopping caplacizumab with a longer time to ADAMTS13 activity >30% (median 139 days after completing PEX). 18/64 (28%) of patients receiving extended caplacizumab (31-58 days) failed to achieve ADAMTS13 activity >30% at time of stopping caplacizumab compared to 4/47 (8.5%) of historical controls at similar timepoint (30+28 days, p<0.0001). Failure to achieve ADAMTS13 activity >30% within 30+28 days was 6 times more likely in caplacizumab treated patients (OR 6.3, p=0.0006). ADAMTS13 antigen level <30% at caplacizumab cessation was associated with increased iTTP recurrence (4/10 vs 0/9 in patients with ADAMTS13 antigen ≥30%). Admission anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibody level did not predict recurrence. Anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibody levels, immunosuppression and ethnicity did not account for differences in ADAMTS13 activity response. ADAMTS13 antigen levels ≥30% may be useful to guide stopping caplacizumab therapy after extended use in patients with ADAMTS13 activity <10%, but patients require close monitoring.

36709677,Long VITT: A case report.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has been described following adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. This condition is associated with important morbidity and mortality following thrombosis related complications. Diagnosis is confirmed based on results of platelet factor 4 ELISA detecting anti-PF4 antibodies and of platelet-activation assay. Initial treatment strategy has been established but long-term management and follow up remain unclear. Most platelet-activation tests become negative after 12 weeks. We describe a case of VITT which can now be characterized as long VITT. The patient initially had a lower limb ischemia, pulmonary embolism and cerebral vein thrombosis. He was treated with prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, argatroban and had a lower limb revascularization surgery. Rivaroxaban was then initiated for the acute treatment and continued for the secondary prevention of recurrent events. The patient still demonstrates positive platelet-activation tests and thrombocytopenia after more than 18 months of follow-up. No recurrent thrombosis or bleeding event have occurred. He is not known for any relevant past medical history other than alcohol consumption and slight thrombocytopenia (130 × 10"
36709264,Two ischemic stroke events within 48 h: a case report of an unusual presentation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) considers a rare cause of ischemic stroke (IS). We reported a case of a newly diagnosed patient with acquired immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), in whom two IS events developed during 48 h.
A 59-year-old diabetic male was presented to the hospital 24 h after symptoms onset, including left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and decreased consciousness. A brain CT scan was performed with the suspicion of acute IS, indicating infarct lesions in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The patient was not eligible for thrombolytic therapy due to admission delay. Over the next 24 h, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated, and the second brain CT scan showed new ischemic lesions in the left MCA territory. Initial laboratory evaluation indicated thrombocytopenia without evidence of anemia. However, in the following days, thrombocytopenia progressed, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) developed. The ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity and inhibitors assay confirmed the diagnosis of iTTP. The patient underwent plasma exchange activity and inhibitors assay confirmed the diagnosis of iTTP. The patient underwent and pulse IV methylprednisolone. Rituximab was also added due to the refractory course of the disease. After a prolonged hospital course, he had considerable neurologic recovery and was discharged.
Clinicians should consider two points. First, TTP should be considered in any patient presenting with IS and having thrombocytopenia or anemia without other symptoms of TTP. Second, worsening the patient's condition during hospitalization may indicate a new stroke and should be investigated immediately."
36708274,Biomarkers for predicting response to corticosteroid therapy for immune thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) often receive corticosteroids as a first-line treatment strategy. The ability to predict the therapeutic response to corticosteroids before initiating treatment would reduce the risk of adverse events, but biomarkers of this parameter have not yet been established. Here, in a single-centre, retrospective, cohort study of 127 ITP patients who received corticosteroids as first-line treatment, we compared several characteristics and test results between those patients with a favourable response to corticosteroids (responder cohort, n = 68) and those with a poor response to corticosteroids (non-responder cohort, n = 59) to identify potential biomarkers that were predictive of corticosteroid response. We extracted six factors as indicative of poor response to corticosteroid therapy for ITP: old age (≥81 years) (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; p = 0.02); low platelet count (<9 × 10"

The probability of the incidence of profound thrombocytopenia following the COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine has been less elucidated. We present the case of an 81-year-old female patient who became profoundly thrombocytopenic with bleeding manifestations six days after the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Fortunately, she exhibited platelet count recovery after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins and steroid therapy. Furthermore, we show that the inherent risk of COVID-19 infection leading to thrombocytopenia significantly outweighs the vaccine's risk."
36699080,"Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy: An updated review of causative drugs, pathophysiology, and management.","Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (DITMA) represents 10%-13% of all thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) cases and about 20%-30% of secondary TMAs, just behind pregnancy-related and infection-related forms. Although the list of drugs potentially involved as causative for TMA are rapidly increasing, the scientific literature on DITMA is quite scarce (mostly as individual case reports or little case series), leading to poor knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical management. In this review, we focused on these critical aspects regarding DITMA. We provided an updated list of TMA-associated drugs that we selected from a scientific literature review, including only those drugs with a definite or probable causal association with TMA. The list of drugs is heterogeneous and could help physicians from several different areas to be familiar with DITMA. We describe the clinical features of DITMA, presenting the full spectrum of clinical manifestations, from systemic to kidney-limited forms. We also analyze the association between signs/symptoms (i.e., malignant hypertension, thrombocytopenia) and specific DITMA causative drugs (i.e., interferon, ticlopidine). We highlighted their multiple different pathophysiological mechanisms, being frequently classified as immune-mediated (idiosyncratic) and dose-related/toxic. In particular, to clarify the role of the complement system and genetic deregulation of the related genes, we conducted a revision of the scientific literature searching for DITMA cases who underwent renal biopsy and/or genetic analysis for complement genes. We identified a complement deposition in renal biopsies in half of the patients (37/66; 57%), with some drugs associated with major deposits (i.e., gemcitabine and ramucirumab), particularly in capillary vessels (24/27; 88%), and other with absent deposits (tyrosine kinase inhibitors and intraocular anti-VEGF). We also found out that, differently from other secondary TMAs (such as pregnancy-related-TMA and malignant hypertension TMA), complement genetic pathological mutations are rarely involved in DITMA (2/122, 1.6%). These data suggest a variable non-genetic complement hyperactivation in DITMA, which probably depends on the causative drug involved. Finally, based on recent literature data, we proposed a treatment approach for DITMA, highlighting the importance of drug withdrawal and the role of therapeutic plasma-exchange (TPE), rituximab, and anti-complementary therapy."
36696206,Impact of first-line use of caplacizumab on treatment outcomes in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"The von Willebrand factor-directed nanobody caplacizumab has greatly changed the treatment of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) in recent years. Data from randomized controlled trials established efficacy and safety.
This study aims to address open questions regarding patient selection, tailoring of therapy duration, obstacles in prescribing caplacizumab in iTTP, effect on adjunct treatment, and outcomes in the real-world setting.
We report retrospective, observational cohorts of 113 iTTP episodes treated with caplacizumab and 119 historical control episodes treated without caplacizumab. We aggregated data from the caplacizumab phase II/III trials and real-world data from France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria (846 episodes, 396 treated with caplacizumab, and 450 historical controls).
Caplacizumab was efficacious in iTTP, independent of the timing of therapy initiation, but curtailed the time of active iTTP only when used in the first-line therapy within 72 hours after diagnosis and until at least partial ADAMTS13-activity remission. Aggregated data from multiple study populations showed that caplacizumab use resulted in significant absolute risk reduction of 2.87% for iTTP-related mortality (number needed to treat 35) and a relative risk reduction of 59%.
Caplacizumab should be used in first line and until ADAMTS13-remission, lowers iTTP-related mortality and refractoriness, and decreases the number of daily plasma exchange and hospital stay. This trial is registered at www.

36696200,Overlapping ADAMTS13 peptide binding profiles of DRB1∗08:03 and DRB1∗11:01 suggest a common etiology of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an ultra-rare autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies against ADAMTS13. A strong association of DRB1∗11 with iTTP and DRB1∗11-restricted T-cell epitopes in ADAMTS13 have been reported in Europeans, whereas we previously found DRB1∗08:03 as a susceptible allele in Japanese.
The limited information is available regarding a susceptible allele and its T-cell epitopes in Japanese patients with iTTP.
We conducted a reanalysis on iTTP-predisposing alleles using 3 distinct Japanese control groups. Subsequently, a novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-peptide expression assay (MHC-density assay) was used to identify the presentation of 24 ADAMTS13-derived peptides, including the regions that were identified previously by MHC-peptidome analysis and/or T-cell assays or predicted by NetMHCIIpan-4.0, to DRB1∗08:03 and DRB1∗11:01.
We reconfirmed the strong association of DRB1∗08:03 with iTTP, as well as the absence of the secondary risk alleles and protective alleles in Japanese iTTP, which altogether reveal that the HLA association pattern is completely different between the European and Japanese iTTP. MHC-density assay found the 3 ADAMTS13-derived peptides in the spacer domain as a potential strong binder to DRB1∗08:03. Moreover, 6 peptides in the metalloprotease, spacer, sixth thrombospondin-1 repeat, and CUB domains in ADAMTS13 showed increased presentation by both DRB1∗08:03 and DRB1∗11:01.
Altogether, the findings of distinct HLA-DR association with iTTP across populations and the presentation of common peptides by DRB1∗08:03 and DRB1∗11:01 suggest that the same ADAMTS13-derived peptides might be presented and trigger the activation of autoreactive CD4"

36670359,Helicobacter pylori eradication rates using clarithromycin and levofloxacin-based regimens in patients with previous COVID-19 treatment: a randomized clinical trial.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is affecting half of the globe. It is considered a main causative organism of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and different gastric maliganacies. It has been also correlated to extraintestinal diseases, including refractory iron deficiency anaemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The misuse of antibiotics during the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic time can affect H. pylori eradication rates. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of clarithromycin versus levofloxacin-based regimens for H. pylori treatment in naïve patients after the COVID-19 pandemic misuse of antibiotics.
A total of 270 naïve H. pylori infected patients with previous treatment for COVID-19 more than 3 months before enrolment were recruited. Patients were randomized to receive either clarithromycin, esomeprazole, and amoxicillin, or levofloxacin, esomeprazole, and amoxicillin.
A total of 270 naïve H. pylori infected patients with previous treatment for COVID-19 more than 3 months before enrolment were included, 135 in each arm. In total, 19 patients in the clarithromycin group and 18 patients in the levofloxacin group stopped treatment after 2-4 days because of side effects or were lost for follow-up. Finally, 116 subjects in the clarithromycin group and 117 in the levofloxacin group were assessed. The eradication rates in intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were: group I, 55.56% and 64.66%; and Group II, 64.44% and 74.36% respectively (p = 0.11).
As COVID-19 pandemic has moved forward fast, high resistance rates of H. pylori to both clarithromycin and levofloxacin were developed after less than two years from the start of the pandemic. Molecular & genetic testing is highly recommended to identify antimicrobial resistance patterns. Strategies to prevent antibiotic misuse in the treatment of COVID-19 are needed to prevent more antibiotic resistance.
The trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov NCT05035186. Date of registration is 2-09-2021."

It is known to be rich in flavonoids, including apigenin glycosides and unique elements of bioflavonoids.
To investigate estrogen-like constituents of SM and the possible mechanism.
We identified the main components in liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The estrogenic effects were examined using a recombinant yeast screening assay, an E-screen cell proliferation assay, and an in vivo uterotrophic assay.
Flavonoid glycosides extract, some flavonoid glycosides, and apigenin showed estrogen agonistic activity in the yeast screening assay. They also induced cell proliferation in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cells but not in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) cells. Consistently, the protein expression of ERα, phosphorylation protein kinase B (p-AKT), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), phosphorylation mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), phosphorylation 38,000-Da protein (p-P38), and phosphorylation extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) elevated following treatment with flavonoid glycoside extract (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). These effects could be blocked by ER antagonist or ERα antagonist but not be blocked by ERβ antagonist. In vivo assay, flavonoid glycoside extract could significantly increase body weight, serum estradiol level, uterine wet weight, alter uterine morphology, and promote ERα protein expression (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05).
ERα induction via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways might be the possible mechanism underlying the phytoestrogen effect of SM, and the flavonoid glycosides might be the critical estrogenic constituents."
36669360,Daratumumab as a novel treatment option in refractory ITP.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients typically presents as a repeatedly relapsing disease in need of multiple lines of therapy. Here we report the clinical courses of two patients, an 82-year-old female and a 54-year-old male, with primary ITP after multiple relapses and exhausted standard therapies, which we treated with the myeloma-licensed anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in an off-label setting. Daratumumab is known to target preferentially plasmablasts, short-lived plasma cells and long-lived plasma cells, with the latter being the major source of antiplatelet autoantibodies. Noteworthy, rituximab, a CD20 antibody, targets earlier steps in B-cell ontogenesis, thereby indirectly decreasing plasmablasts and short-lived plasma cells, but to a lesser extent long-lived plasma cells, which tend to persist after rituximab treatment. Several single-patient reports and case series have demonstrated successful treatment with daratumumab in ITP, autoimmune thrombocytopenia in Evans syndrome as well as other cytopenias or pure red cell aplasia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation or in congenital diseases, systemic lupus erythematodes and cold agglutinin disease.

ITP target proteins were collected from various databases. Then, KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses were performed to explore the signaling pathways related to HQHG for ITP. The PPI and drug-herbs-compounds-targets-pathways network were constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.2. Finally, Discovery studio software was used to confirm the key targets and active compounds from HQHG.
A total of 187 interacting targets of 19 potentially active compounds in HQHG and 3837 ITP-related targets were collected. Then, 187 intersection targets were obtained. A total of 20 key targets including EGFR, CASP3, TNF, STAT3, and ERBB2 were identified through PPI network analysis. These targets were mainly focused on the biological processes of positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, cellular response to organonitrogen compound, and cellular response to nitrogen compound. 20 possible pathways of HQHG in the treatment of ITP were identified through KEGG enrichment. EGFR, CASP3, TNF, and STAT3 are the four most important target proteins, while adenosine, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin-3
This study demonstrated that HQHG produced relief effects against ITP by regulating multitargets and multipathways with multicompounds. And the combined data provide novel insight of drug developing for ITP."

36658588,How we treat primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an immune-mediated bleeding disorder characterized by decreased platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. Multiple humoral and cellular immune abnormalities result in accelerated platelet destruction and suppressed platelet production in ITP. The diagnosis remains a clinical exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia. Treatment is not required except for patients with active bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, or cases in need of invasive procedures. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti-RhD immunoglobulin are the classical initial treatments for newly diagnosed ITP in adults, but these agents generally cannot induce a long-term response in most patients. Subsequent treatments for patients who fail the initial therapy include thrombopoietic agents, rituximab, fostamatinib, splenectomy, and several older immunosuppressive agents. Other potential therapeutic agents, such as inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and neonatal Fc receptor, are currently under clinical evaluation. An optimized treatment strategy should aim at elevating the platelet counts to a safety level with minimal toxicity and improving patient health-related quality of life, and always needs to be tailored to the patients and disease phases. In this review, we address the concepts of adult ITP diagnosis and management and provide a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic strategies under general and specific situations."

Of 32 patients included in this analysis, majority (59.4%) were females. The mean (SD) age was 40.37 (15.79) years, and mean age at ITP diagnosis was 38.53 years. The median number of romiplostim doses were 27.5 (range: 10-42) over a period of 10 months; median romiplostim dose used was 4.2 μg/kg (range: 2.8-5 μg/kg). Platelet response was achieved as early as after one week in 9 (28.12%) patients, which continued to increase to 24 (75%) patients after the second, 30 (93.75%) patients after the third and all 32 (100%) patients after four weeks of romiplostim administration. The median platelet count was 161 × 10

Randomized controlled clinical trials were collected by systematically searching databases (PubMed®, MEDLINE®, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure) from inception to June 2022. All studies included patients with ITP who received cyclosporine-based regimens. We performed comprehensive analyses of the overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate, relapse rate, platelet count, and adverse drug reaction (ADR) rate.
Seven studies (n = 418) were ultimately included. According to a fixed-effects model, cyclosporine-based combinations improved the ORR and CR rate and reduced the relapse rate. The ADR rate was not increased in the cyclosporine-based combination group. Cyclosporine-based regimens effectively increased the platelet count. Subgroup analysis illustrated that cyclosporine-based combinations were linked to higher ORRs in both children (odds ratio [OR] = 5.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.79-18.41) and adults (OR = 5.46, 95% CI = 2.48-12.02) and a higher CR rate in adults (OR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.56-5.63).

36648880,Thrombotic Microangiopathy in the Setting of Colorectal Cancer: A Therapeutic Challenge with a Bad Prognosis.,"While most cases of thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are idiopathic, some can occur in the setting of a malignancy. Differentiating both conditions is crucial to initiate the appropriate treatment. In this case report and literature review, we discuss the occurrence of a thrombotic microangiopathy in a 61-year-old male patient with a treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer invading his bone marrow. Plasmapheresis does not constitute the mainstay of treatment in this setting, as targeting the primary disease is the ultimate management. Treating the condition of our patient has been challenging as multiple lines of treatments of his primary disease had been exhausted. The discrepancy in KRAs status obtained between PCR and later NGS offered a new treatment line with Cetuximab. In this article, we will discuss the different factors that differentiate between idiopathic and cancer-induced microangiopathy. We will emphasize on the fact that the treatment of the primary disease constitutes the most important step in the treatment of cancer-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. We will also raise several explanations to target the disagreement in KRAS status obtained by the different technical modalities."

36637776,Combination regimens containing daratumumab for initial diagnosed acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and organ ischemia associated with disseminated microvascular platelet-rich thrombus. Before the introduction of plasma therapy, acute TTP was almost universally fatal, which improved survival from < 10 to 80-90%. However, patients who survived an acute attack were at high risk for recurrence and long-term morbidity. It was reported that daratumumab can eradicate persistent ADAMTS13-inhibiting autoantibodies and restore ADAMTS13 activity in two patients with relapsed immune-mediated TTP without associated adverse drug reactions. Here we report a case series of patients with initial diagnosed acquired TTP treated with combination regimens containing daratumumab. All the patients achieved clinical response after the initial treatment. Three patients achieved clinical remission, one patient relapsed and one patient suffered an exacerbation during follow-up. The two patients were retreated with glucocorticoids, plasma exchange combined with daratumumab, and clinical remission was achieved again. Combination of daratumumab in the treatment of initial diagnosed acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can rapidly restore ADAMST13 activity and turn negative for ADAMST13 inhibitors, resulting in long-term remission in patients."
36636835,Complement activation negatively affects the platelet response to thrombopoietin receptor agonists in patients with immune thrombocytopenia: a prospective cohort study.,"Increased platelet destruction is central in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia. However, impaired platelet production is also relevant and its significance underlies the rationale for treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs). Previous studies have associated enhanced complement activation with increased disease severity. Additionally, treatment refractoriness has been demonstrated to resolve by the administration of complement-targeted therapeutics in a subset of patients. The association between complement activation and the platelet response to TPO-RA therapy has previously not been investigated. In this study, blood samples from patients with immune thrombocytopenia (n = 15) were prospectively collected before and two, six and 12 weeks after the initiation of TPO-RA therapy. Plasma levels of complement degradation product C4d and soluble terminal complement complexes were assessed.

However, access to this drug remains challenging in many jurisdictions. We retrospectively review results of a single-institution experience with caplacizumab over a 3-year period. During the study period, we treated 48 patients with iTTP, of which 11 (23%) received caplacizumab. Eight of these 11 patients (73%) were female; the median age was 45 years (IQR 37.0-58.5). All received TPE within 24 h of admission (median 9 exchanges, IQR 7.0-12.5), and high-dose steroids. Caplacizumab was initiated for a median of 6 days after admission (IQR 2.5-8.0) and continued for a median of 26 days (IQR 14.0-33.0). Five patients (45%) had refractory disease at caplacizumab initiation. Ten patients (91%) survived, reaching clinical remission. Platelet normalization was reached with a median of 4 days following caplacizumab initiation (IQR 1.5-4.0). Complications included minor bleeding (n = 1) and local allergic reaction (n = 1). No patients experienced TTP exacerbation; relapse occurred in two patients (18%) over 1-5 years of follow-up. Caplacizumab appeared to be effective and safe, despite delayed initiation and in the setting of refractory disease.
Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening blood condition characterized by low platelets, anemia, and formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels. The condition results from a patient’s immune system attacking a blood protein called ADAMTS13. The standard treatment for iTTP is plasma exchange (which replaces ADAMTS13) and medications, which suppress the immune system. Recently, a new medication, caplacizumab, has been shown to improve outcomes in iTTP, if combined with a standard treatment. However, this drug is expensive, and not readily available in all parts of the world, including Canada. In this article, we present the first Canadian experience with caplacizumab. Due to its limited access, the drug is frequently used in patients who are refractory to standard treatment or presented with severe organ damage. This contrasts with previously published studies, where it has been used upfront and in all patients with TTP. We find that caplacizumab may be safe and effective in this setting, demonstrating a low mortality rate and rapid recovery in most patients. While upfront and universal use of caplacizumab in the treatment of iTTP is optimal, our approach could be used in settings, where access to this medication is restricted."

This ITP World Impact Survey was conducted between October 2019 and October 2020. Of the 114 patients included in the survey, 17 were aged ≤18 years. Forty-seven physicians, including 22 pediatric hematologists, participated in the survey. Fatigue and anxiety around stable platelet counts were frequent patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis and at survey completion. According to physicians, ""watch-and-wait"" was the preferred treatment option for mean (standard deviation) proportion of 50.1 (24.1) and 48.6 (21.8) of their adult and pediatric patients, respectively, following first diagnosis. Per adult and pediatric hematologists, the most prescribed treatments for newly diagnosed patients based on available answers were steroids (100%, n = 20/20; 89%, n = 16/18), respectively. Forty percent of adult (n = 10/25) and 38% of pediatric hematologists (n = 8/21) reported that ITP reduced patients' quality of life. Energy levels (46%, n = 52/112) and ability to concentrate on everyday activities (42%, n = 47/113) were the most affected aspects of patients' lives.

36622549,Recent progress in ITP treatment.,"In this review, the recently approved drugs avatrombopag and fostamatinib, which were not extensively covered within 2019 international recommendations for ITP, will be discussed in some detail. Avatrombopag appears more convenient than eltrombopag as it does not require dietary restrictions or subcutaneous administration like romiplostim. However, data on quality of life (QoL) are lacking and the rate of thromboembolic events in exposed patients is not negligible. Efficacy of fostamatinib, an inhibitor of macrophagic activity, is supported by placebo-controlled trials in patients refractory to several therapies, including TPO-RA. While hypertension and diarrhea have been reported, only one minor thrombotic event occurred in 146 exposed patients. In addition, several new treatment combinations and new agents entered clinical investigation in recent years. In a UK trial, combining mycophenolate mofetil with corticosteroids as first line therapy was more effective than corticosteroids alone, but at the cost of worse QoL. No combination, including oseltamivir or all-trans retinoic acid or danazol, resulted in convincing evidence of superior efficacy and safety when used in first or later lines of treatment. Agents targeting specific mechanisms are also discussed: sutimlimab (complement inhibitor); rilzabrutinib (BTK inhibitor) and efgartigimod (modified Fc fragment inhibiting FcRn). Only efgartigimod has completed phase 3 investigation."
36617702,Advances in management of pediatric chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a narrative review.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disease in which thrombocytopenia occurs because of immune-mediated platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Although many pediatric patients with ITP experience spontaneous remission or reach remission within 12 months of first-line therapy, approximately 20% progress to chronic ITP. Patients who do not respond to first-line treatment or experience frequent relapses are of great concern to physicians. This review summarizes recent treatments for second-line treatment of pediatric chronic ITP."

VITT is characterized by thrombosis, typically at unusual sites, low fibrinogen, and elevated plasma D-dimer, generally manifesting between 4 and 28 days following vaccination. Detection of anti-platelet factor antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is often confirmatory. Although several similar principles subside in most diagnostic criteria for VITT, the presentation of a positive ELISA assay, use of expert hematology and neurology opinion, and exclusion of possible VITT cases outside the ""standard"" 4 to 28-day timeframe have contributed a lack of global standardization for defining VITT. Accordingly, the global and regional incidence of VITT differs according to the diagnostic pathway and case definition used. This has influenced the public perception of VITT's severity and the decision to use adenovirus vector-based vaccines for limiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We hereby delineate the recognized pathogenic mechanisms, global incidence, discrepancies in diagnostic criteria, recommended treatments, and global implications to vaccine hesitancy from this coagulopathy."

36601709,Survival in adult patients with chronic primary and secondary immune thrombocytopenia: A population-based study.,"Few studies have investigated long-term survival in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (pITP). Further, changes in prognosis over the past decades and prognosis of secondary immune thrombocytopenia (sITP) are largely unstudied. Our objectives were to study comorbidity-adjusted prognostic changes and causes of death in chronic pITP and sITP patients.
Using nationwide Danish health registries 1980-2016, we identified 1762 patients with chronic pITP (median age 58 (IQR, 37-73) years) and 128 with chronic sITP (median age 59 (IQR, 40-73) years). Patients were age-sex-matched to 74,781 general population comparators. Comorbidity was assessed using Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).
Overall median survival was reduced by 5.1 years (95% CI, 0.7-9.4) (p < .001) for pITP and 11.1 years (95% CI, 5.8-16.4) (p < .001) for sITP. 5-year survival increased from 69% (95% CI, 59-78) in 1980-89 to 80% (95% CI, 75-83) in 2010-16 for pITP, and decreased from 100% (95% CI, 89-98) to 64% (95% CI, 87-91) for sITP. However, numbers were small for sITP. 5-year survival for pITP with high CCI was 41% (95% CI, 32-49), and 85% (95% CI, 83-87) for low CCI. Bleeding, infection and hematological cancer were relatively frequent causes of death with adjusted subhazard ratios of 3.25 (95% CI, 2.33-4.52), 1.53 (95% CI, 1.08-2.16) and 2.16 (95% CI, 1.12-4.16) in pITP respectively, and 10.52 (95% CI, 1.43-77.36) for hematological cancer in sITP.
Long-term survival is reduced in chronic ITP but seems to be improving. Comorbidity and sITP are associated with a poor prognosis."
36600572,Immune-Mediated Adverse Drug Reactions (IM-ARDs) in the Form of Drug-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions (CARD) Due to Clindamycin in an Human Immunodeficieny Virus (HIV) Patient.,"BACKGROUND Many drugs have been reported to cause immune-mediated adverse drug reactions (IM-ADRs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients; the most common is cutaneous adverse drug reaction (CADR). Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is frequent in HIV patients, and it can be caused HIV, opportunistic infections, or drugs. Although drugs can cause immune thrombocytopenia, termed drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DIIT), there has been no study on DIIT in HIV patients. CASE REPORT A 33-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with pruritic skin lesion over the entire body, which started 7 days before. He was diagnosed with HIV infection, brain toxoplasmosis, and pulmonary tuberculosis 2 weeks before admission, and was given trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Clindamycin was added 10 days before admission. Skin examination revealed generalized erythematous macules with palpable petechiae and purpura. The platelet count was 141 000/µL when he was diagnosed with HIV, and it was 2000/µL at the time of admission. Clindamycin was discontinued and he was given steroids and platelet transfusion. The skin lesions improved along with an increased platelet count. He was discharged on the 10th day of admission, with platelet count of 42 000/µL. When he returned to the outpatient clinic on the 15th day, his platelet was 54 000/µL. The skin lesions had resolved completely and become hyperpigmented, and no purpura or petechiae were seen. CONCLUSIONS We present a case of an HIV patient with IM-ADR in the form of DIIT in conjunction with CADR that might have been caused by clindamycin."

36594290,Prolonged Thrombocytopenia in a Case of MIS-C in a Vaccinated Child.,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been extensively described in patients following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. There are now questions about what MIS-C may look like in vaccinated children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has many clinical and laboratory features in common with other inflammatory disorders including Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Rheumatologic conditions can present with similar musculoskeletal complaints and elevated inflammatory markers. Laboratory markers and clinical symptoms of MIS-C usually improve once therapy is begun. We describe a child with persistent thrombocytopenia as an example of variable presentation of MIS-C in vaccinated children. This case report discusses an atypical progression of MIS-C in a vaccinated child with a known prior positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. She presented with nonspecific abdominal pain and fever and was found to have elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid treatment failed to induce rapid recovery in her clinical condition or thrombocytopenia. Rheumatologic, hematologic, oncologic, and infectious causes were considered and worked up due to the uncertainty of her case and persistence of pancytopenia but ultimately were ruled out with extensive testing and monitoring. It was key to include a broad differential including viral-induced bone marrow suppression, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and malignancy. The spectrum of MIS-C and response to treatment continues to evolve, and prior vaccination in this child's case complicated the clinical picture further. Additional evaluation of MIS-C in vaccinated cases will permit characterization of the range of MIS-C presentation and response to standard therapy."
36582494,Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis Masquerading as Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and leukocytoclastic vasculitis can present in a similar fashion and can be very hard to differentiate clinically without a biopsy. This can cause diagnostic dilemma and delay in management. A thorough evaluation is recommended to determine etiology, although about half are idiopathic.
A patient aged 79 years with longstanding thrombocytopenia secondary to chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura presented with a rash. Although it was thought to be secondary to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a biopsy revealed presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
Although most leukocytoclastic vasculitis cases are mild and resolve without intervention, many go undiagnosed due to biopsy delays. Health care professionals should determine and treat the underlying cause."

36579787,Pediatric refractory immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review.,"Pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired disorder associated with autoimmune destruction and impairment of platelet production in children. Some children exhibit poor or transient response to ITP-directed treatments and are referred to as having refractory ITP (rITP). There is currently no consensus on the definition of rITP, nor evidence-based treatment guidelines for patients with rITP. After a survey of pediatric ITP experts demonstrated lack of consensus on pediatric rITP, we pursued a systematic review to examine the reported clinical phenotypes and treatment outcomes in pediatric rITP. The search identified 253 relevant manuscripts; following review, 11 studies proposed a definition for pediatric rITP with no consensus amongst them. Most definitions included suboptimal response to medical management, while some outlined specific platelet thresholds to define this suboptimal response. Common attributes identified in this study should be used to propose a comprehensive definition, which will facilitate outcome comparisons of future rITP studies."

36576539,Secondary immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy: a case-based review.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a potentially fatal acquired thrombotic microangiopathy syndrome that frequently develops in the context of infectious diseases or systemic autoimmune conditions including connective tissue diseases. We report the case of a 42-year-old female suffering from severe iTTP associated with anti-Jo-1 positive antisynthetase syndrome, which was successfully treated with combination therapy of intravenous immune globulin, rituximab and plasma exchange. Based on a systematic review of the literature, two additional cases of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-associated iTTP (secondary iTTP) were identified. In conclusion, iTTP may be a rare complication of IIM that clinicians should consider in cases of marked thrombocytopenia. Further work-up of this finding should include a peripheral blood smear (schistocyte count) and ADAMTS13 activity. The concomitant manifestation of these autoimmune conditions may require intensive immunosuppressive therapy."
36574587,Clinical and Clinicopathologic Discriminators Between Canine Acute Monocytic Ehrlichiosis and Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Acute canine monocytic ehrlichiosis due to Ehrlichia canis (aCME), and primary immune thrombocytopenia (pITP) are major differentials for dogs presented with thrombocytopenia, and the two diseases may clinically overlap. The aim of this study was to compare dogs diagnosed with naturally occurring aCME and pITP, to establish potentially useful clinical and clinicopathologic discriminators. A clinical record-based retrospective study was performed in 35 dogs diagnosed with aCME and 29 dogs with pITP. Dogs with aCME were significantly younger, and were more likely to experience depression or lethargy, anorexia, body weight loss, fever, lymphadenomegaly, tick infestation, and ocular discharge on admission, compared to dogs with pITP. In contrast, dogs with pITP presented more frequently with overt bleeding and had a significantly higher bleeding score compared to dogs with aCME. Dogs with aCME were more likely to be anemic and hypoalbuminemic on presentation compared to dogs with pITP. Dogs with pITP had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts as well as lower platelet counts than dogs with aCME and were more likely to present with leukocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis. These clinical, hematological, and biochemical findings may be helpful discriminators between aCME and pITP, on the understanding that they will be interpreted in the context of disease-specific testing."
36574172,Unique features of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia; a new anti-platelet factor 4 antibody-mediated disorder.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a highly prothrombotic disorder caused by anti-PF4 antibodies that activate platelets and neutrophils, leading to thrombosis. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a related anti-PF4 mediated disorder, with similar pathophysiology and clinical manifestations but different triggers (i.e., heparin vs adenoviral vector vaccine). Clinically, both HIT and VITT typically present with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, although the risk of thrombosis is significantly higher in VITT, and the thromboses occur in unusual anatomical sites (e.g., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis). The diagnostic accuracy of available laboratory testing differs between HIT and VITT; for VITT, ELISAs have better specificity compared to HIT and platelet activation assays require the addition of PF4. Treatment of VITT and HIT is anticoagulation non-heparin anticoagulants; however, heparin may be considered for VITT if no other option is available."
36562217,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura secondary to COVID-19 vaccination: A systematic review.,"This systematic review aimed to retrieve patients diagnosed with de novo immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after COVID-19 immunization to determine their epidemiological characteristics, clinical course, therapeutic strategies, and outcome.
We conducted the review using four major databases, comprising PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library, until April 2022. A systematic search was performed in duplicate to access eligible articles in English. Furthermore, a manual search was applied to the chosen papers' references to enhance the search sensitivity. Data were extracted and analyzed with the SPSS 20.1 software.
A total of 77 patients with de novo COVID-19 vaccine-associated ITP were identified from 41 studies, including 31 case reports and 10 case series. The median age of patients who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated ITP was 54 years (IQR 36-72 years). The mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, including BNT16B2b2 and mRNA-1273, were most implicated (75.4%). Those were followed by the adenovirus vector-based vaccines, inclusive of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and vAd26.COV2.S. No report was found relating ITP to other COVID-19 vaccines. Most cases (79.2%) developed ITP after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. 75% of the patients developed ITP within 12 days of vaccination, indicating a shorter lag time compared to ITP after routine childhood vaccinations. Sixty-seven patients (87%) patients were hospitalized. The management pattern was similar to primary ITP, and systemic glucocorticoids, IVIg, or both were the basis of the treatment in most patients. Most patients achieved therapeutic goals; only two individuals required a secondary admission, and one patient who presented with intracranial hemorrhage died of the complication.
De novo ITP is a rare complication of COVID-19 vaccination, and corresponding reports belong to mRNA-based and adenovirus vector-based vaccines, in order of frequency. This frequency pattern may be related to the scale of administration of individual vaccines and their potency in inducing autoimmunity. The more the COVID-19 vaccine is potent to induce antigenic challenge, the shorter the lag time would be. Most patients had a benign course and responded to typical treatments of primary ITP."

PubMed, EMBASE and Cohrane library databases were searched for all randomized controlled trials published until 2022, and the Review Manager 5.3 was used for meta-analysis.
A total of 9 randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The results of meta-analysis showed that the total platelet response rate and long-term platelet response rate in treatment group were significantly higher than those in control group (P<0.05). There was no statistical significance in the side effects, serious side effects, bleeding events and serious bleeding events between 2 groups (P>0.05). Compared with control group, the HRQoL in ITP adults and children, and parents of ITP children had no statistical significance (P>0.05).
Romiplostim has a certain clinical efficacy in ITP adults and children, and relatively small adverse drug reactions. The improvement of Romiplostim on HRQoL in ITP adults and children is not clear."
36549758,Invasive management of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia secondary to adult-onset immune thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Managing patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and thrombocytopenia is challenging when they present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). They are at high risk of thrombotic events; however, antiplatelet medications may further lower the platelet count and predispose them to significant bleeding events, especially if undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We present a case of a man in his 70s, previously diagnosed with adult-onset ITP, admitted with ACS and severe thrombocytopenia. He was treated with a single antiplatelet and commenced on high-dose steroids. Once platelet levels had improved, he was started on second antiplatelet and underwent successful PCI with drug-eluting stent. He was safely discharged with dual antiplatelets for 1 month and then lifelong clopidogrel without any immediate complications. Our case shows that such patients, if stable, can be safely and successfully treated with steroids to improve platelet count before proceeding to invasive management and dual antiplatelet medications."

36542424,[Clinical evolution of 31 adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia treated with rituximab].,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that could cause different grades of bleeding, which could even threat the patients' life or make them experience poor quality of life. ITP can be treated with rituximab either as a first or second-line therapy option, resulting in an overall response of 60%. The best results have been observed on young women with a short time of disease evolution.
To report the response and clinical evolution by providing therapy with rituximab, which was used as a rescue in adult patients with either persistent or chronical ITP.
4 weekly doses of rituximab were administered to 31 adult patients and it was made a follow-up with them for a year.

36537217,An update on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency defines thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). ADAMTS13 is responsible for VWF cleavage. In the absence of this enzyme, widespread thrombi formation occurs, causing microangiopathic anemia and thrombocytopenia and leading to ischemic organ injury. Understanding ADAMTS13 function is crucial to diagnose and manage TTP, both in the immune and hereditary forms.
The role of ADAMTS13 in coagulation homeostasis and the consequences of its deficiency are detailed. Other factors that modulate the consequences of ADAMTS13 deficiency are explained, such as complement system activation, genetic predisposition, or the presence of an inflammatory status. Clinical suspicion of TTP is crucial to start prompt treatment and avoid mortality and sequelae. Available techniques to diagnose this deficiency and detect autoantibodies or gene mutations are presented, as they have become faster and more available in recent years.
A better knowledge of TTP pathophysiology is leading to an improvement in diagnosis and follow-up, as well as a customized treatment in patients with TTP. This scenario is necessary to define the role of new targeted therapies already available or coming soon and the need to better diagnose and monitor at the molecular level the evolution of the disease."
36535011,Switching between eltrombopag and recombinant human thrombopoietin in patients with immune thrombocytopenia: an observational study.,"Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rh-TPO) and eltrombopag are two distinct TPO receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) with different mechanisms. During the pandemic, when immunosuppressive medications are controversial, switching to another TPO-RA may be worth exploring in patients who do not benefit from their first TPO-RA. We investigated the outcomes of switching from rh-TPO to eltrombopag or vice versa in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients.
This prospective, open-label, observational investigation included 96 adult ITP patients who needed to switch between rh-TPO and eltrombopag between January 2020 and January 2021 at Peking University People's Hospital in China. The study evaluated response rates and platelet counts at different time points after the switch, bleeding events, time to response, duration of response, and adverse events.
At 6 weeks after switching, response was observed in 21/49 patients (43%) who switched for inefficacy and 34/47 patients (72%) who switched for non-efficacy-related issues. In the inefficacy group, 9/27 patients (33%) responded to eltrombopag, and 12/22 patients (55%) responded to rh-TPO. In the non-efficacy-related group, 21/26 (81%) and 13/21 (62%) patients in the eltrombopag and rh-TPO groups maintained their response rates at 6 weeks after switching, respectively. Response at 6 months was achieved in 24/49 patients (49%) switching for inefficacy and 37/47 patients (79%) switching for non-efficacy issues. In the inefficacy group, 13/27 patients (48%) responded to eltrombopag, and 11/22 patients (50%) responded to rh-TPO. In the non-efficacy-related group, 22/26 patients (85%) and 15/21 patients (71%) in the eltrombopag and rh-TPO groups maintained their response rates at 6 months after switching, respectively. Both eltrombopag and rh-TPO were well tolerated.
Our study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of switching between rh-TPO and eltrombopag for ITP patients who had no response to or experienced adverse events with their first TPO-RA. When the switch was motivated by other reasons, including patient preference and platelet count fluctuations, the probability of response was high.

36531671,Effects of convalescent plasma infusion on the ADAMTS13-von Willebrand factor axis and endothelial integrity in patients with severe and critical COVID-19.,"Convalescent plasma infusion (CPI) was given to patients with COVID-19 during the early pandemic with mixed therapeutic efficacy. However, the impacts of CPI on the ADAMTS13-von Willebrand factor (VWF) axis and vascular endothelial functions are not known.
To determine the impacts of CPI on the ADAMTS13-VWF axis and vascular endothelial functions.
Sixty hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study; 46 received CPI and 14 received no CPI. Plasma ADAMTS13 activity, VWF antigen, endothelial syndecan-1, and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) were assessed before and 24 hours after treatment.
Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 exhibited significantly lower plasma ADAMTS13 activity than the healthy controls. Conversely, these patients showed a significantly increased VWF antigen. This resulted in markedly reduced ratios of ADAMTS13 to VWF in these patients. The levels of plasma ADAMTS13 activity in each patient remained relatively constant throughout hospitalization. Twenty-four hours following CPI, plasma ADAMTS13 activity increased by ∼12% from the baseline in all patients and ∼21% in those who survived. In contrast, plasma levels of VWF antigen varied significantly over time. Patients who died exhibited a significant reduction of plasma VWF antigen from the baseline 24 hours following CPI, whereas those who survived did not. Furthermore, patients with severe and critical COVID-19 showed significantly elevated plasma levels of syndecan-1 and sTM, similar to those found in patients with immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Both syndecan-1 and sTM levels were significantly reduced 24 hours following CPI.
Our results demonstrate the relative deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity and endothelial damage in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, which could be modestly improved following CPI therapy."
36523352,COVID-19-Induced Fatal Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura in a Healthy Young Patient.,"Since the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, findings indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might induce autoimmune disorders. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a devastating disease if not emergently treated. It presents with severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurologic findings with or without renal insufficiency. The antibody-mediated reduced activity of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) induces the accumulation of ultrahigh-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor, leading to platelet aggregation and thrombosis. TTP can be an unusual presentation of COVID-19 disease mediated by the virus-induced immune response. We report a case of a healthy young patient presenting with the classic TTP pentad a few days after a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. The patient was initially treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and fresh frozen plasma until she was transferred to a tertiary care facility and plasma exchange was available. She evolved with a malignant ischemic vascular accident and was declared brain-dead 24 hours after the first plasma exchange section."
36518083,Utilization of an ITP quality improvement pathway improves adherence to management guidelines.,"Despite availability of epidemiologic studies and national guidelines for the management of newly diagnosed pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), practice variation exists among and within hematology practices. We previously described the development of an ITP pathway guiding management based on bleeding symptoms. Over an 8-year period, integration of this iterative ITP pathway into management of newly diagnosed ITP increased observation rates in children with no or mild bleeding symptoms and improved consistency of laboratory evaluation and treatment strategies without increasing adverse outcomes. This quality improvement initiative has been sustainable, acceptable to providers, and increased adherence to guidelines."
36504518,Recombinant human thrombopoietin treatment in patients with chronic liver disease-related thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures: A retrospective study.,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) related thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding and poor prognosis. Many liver disease patients require invasive procedures or surgeries, such as liver biopsy or endoscopic variceal ligation, and most of them have lower platelet counts, which could aggravate the risk of bleeding due to liver dysfunction and coagulation disorders. Unfortunately, there is no defined treatment modality for CLD-induced thrombocytopenia. Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is commonly used to treat primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombocytopenia caused by solid tumor chemotherapy; however, there are few reports on the use of rhTPO in the treatment of CLD-related thrombocytopenia.
To evaluate the efficacy of rhTPO in the treatment of patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures.
All analyses were based on the retrospective collection of clinical data of patients with CLD who were treated in the Department of Infectious Diseases at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between June 2020 and December 2021. Fifty-nine male and 41 female patients with liver disease were enrolled in this study to assess the changes in platelet counts and parameters before and after the use of rhTPO for thrombocytopenia. Adverse events related to treatment, such as bleeding, thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, were also investigated.
Among the enrolled patients, 78 (78%) showed a platelet count increase after rhTPO use, while 22 (22%) showed no significant change in platelet count. The mean platelet count after rhTPO treatment in all patients was 101.53 ± 81.81 × 10
rhTPO can improve platelet count, reduce the risk of bleeding, and decrease the platelet transfusion rate, which may promote the safety of invasive procedures and improve overall survival of patients with CLD."
36496287,Surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine safety among elderly persons aged 65 years and older.,"Monitoring safety outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination is critical for understanding vaccine safety especially when used in key populations such as elderly persons age 65 years and older who can benefit greatly from vaccination. We present new findings from a nationally representative early warning system that may expand the safety knowledge base to further public trust and inform decision making on vaccine safety by government agencies, healthcare providers, interested stakeholders, and the public.
We evaluated 14 outcomes of interest following COVID-19 vaccination using the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data covering 30,712,101 elderly persons. The CMS data from December 11, 2020 through Jan 15, 2022 included 17,411,342 COVID-19 vaccinees who received a total of 34,639,937 doses. We conducted weekly sequential testing and generated rate ratios (RR) of observed outcome rates compared to historical (or expected) rates prior to COVID-19 vaccination.
Four outcomes met the threshold for a statistical signal following BNT162b2 vaccination including pulmonary embolism (PE; RR = 1.54), acute myocardial infarction (AMI; RR = 1.42), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; RR = 1.91), and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; RR = 1.44). After further evaluation, only the RR for PE still met the statistical threshold for a signal; however, the RRs for AMI, DIC, and ITP no longer did. No statistical signals were identified following vaccination with either the mRNA-1273 or Ad26 COV2.S vaccines.
This early warning system is the first to identify temporal associations for PE, AMI, DIC, and ITP following BNT162b2 vaccination in the elderly. Because an early warning system does not prove that the vaccines cause these outcomes, more robust epidemiologic studies with adjustment for confounding, including age and nursing home residency, are underway to further evaluate these signals. FDA strongly believes the potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the potential risks of COVID-19 infection."

36485134,Thrombopoietin receptor agonists for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia: a new solution for an old problem.,"Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is common, resulting in increased bleeding risk and chemotherapy delays, dose reduction, and treatment discontinuation, which can negatively affect oncologic outcomes. The only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to manage CIT (oprelvekin) was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by the manufacturer, leaving few options for patients. Therefore, patients experiencing CIT present a significant clinical challenge in daily practice. The availability of thrombopoietin receptor agonists has led to formal clinical trials describing efficacy in CIT as well as a rather extensive body of published observational data from off-label use in this setting but no formal regulatory indications for CIT to date. The accumulated data, however, have affected National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, which now recommend consideration of TPO-RA clinical trials as well as off-label use of romiplostim. This review article details the evidence to date for the management of CIT with thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), discussing the efficacy data, the specific circumstances when treatment is warranted (and when it is generally unnecessary), and safety considerations. Specific recommendations regarding patient selection, initiation, dosing, titration, and discontinuation for TPO-RA therapy in CIT are given, based on published data and expert opinion where evidence is lacking."
36485111,Thrombocytopenia and liver disease: pathophysiology and periprocedural management.,"Abnormal bleeding in patients with liver disease may result from elevated portal pressure and varix formation, reduced hepatic synthesis of coagulation proteins, qualitative platelet dysfunction, and/or thrombocytopenia. Major mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in liver disease include splenic sequestration and impaired platelet production due to reduced thrombopoietin production. Alcohol and certain viruses may induce marrow suppression. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may co-occur in patients with liver disease, particularly those with autoimmune liver disease or chronic hepatitis C. Drugs used for the treatment of liver disease or its complications, such as interferon, immunosuppressants, and antibiotics, may cause thrombocytopenia. Periprocedural management of thrombocytopenia of liver disease depends on both individual patient characteristics and the bleeding risk of the procedure. Patients with a platelet count higher than or equal to 50 000/µL and those requiring low-risk procedures rarely require platelet-directed therapy. For those with a platelet count below 50 000/µL who require a high-risk procedure, platelet-directed therapy should be considered, especially if the patient has other risk factors for bleeding, such as abnormal bleeding with past hemostatic challenges. We often target a platelet count higher than or equal to 50 000/µL in such patients. If the procedure is elective, we prefer treatment with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist; if it is urgent, we use platelet transfusion. In high-risk patients who have an inadequate response to or are otherwise unable to receive these therapies, other strategies may be considered, such as a trial of empiric ITP therapy, spleen-directed therapy, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement."
36485110,Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.,"Hematologists are often consulted for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, especially when there is a concern for a non-pregnancy-specific etiology or an insufficient platelet count for the hemostatic challenges of delivery. The severity of thrombocytopenia and trimester of onset can help guide the differential diagnosis. Hematologists need to be aware of the typical signs of preeclampsia with severe features and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to help distinguish these conditions, which typically resolve with delivery, from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or complement-mediated TMA). Patients with chronic thrombocytopenic conditions, such as immune thrombocytopenia, should receive counseling on the safety and efficacy of various medications during pregnancy. The management of pregnant patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are refractory to first-line treatments is an area that warrants further research. This review uses a case-based approach to discuss recent updates in diagnosing and managing thrombocytopenia in pregnancy."

Here, we report a case of Evans' syndrome, a combination of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia following administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The present case further supports the notion that COVID-19 vaccines can trigger in rare cases severe persistent autoimmune-mediated hematological conditions which may predominantly occur in patients with underlying autoimmune conditions."
36480334,A novel monoclonal antibody with improved FcγR blocking ability demonstrated non-inferior efficacy compared to IVIG in cynomolgus monkey ITP model at considerably lower dose.,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a well-established treatment for various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the standard dose prescribed for autoimmune diseases, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), is 2 g/kg, which is markedly high and leads to a high treatment burden. In this study, we generated fragment crystallizable (Fc)-modified anti-haptoglobin (Hp) monoclonal antibodies with non-inferior efficacy compared to IVIG at considerably lower doses than IVIG, as shown by in vitro experiments. We evaluated binding activity of anti-Hp antibodies to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) with ELISA and inhibitory activity against the ADCC reaction. Furthermore, we successfully established a novel cynomolgus monkey ITP model and demonstrated that the anti-Hp antibody exerted its effect in this model with only a single dose. This Fc-modified anti-Hp monoclonal antibody could be a valuable therapeutic replacement for IVIG for the treatment of ITP."
36478591,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, activation of the thrombopoietin receptor promotes T-cell inhibitory properties, contributing to immunosuppression.","In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the immune system is skewed towards a suppressive milieu. Levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), promoting cellular immune regulatory activity in immune thrombocytopenic purpura, were shown to be elevated in CLL patients. This study explored TPO as a potential immunomodulator, supporting CLL progression. We evaluated CLL cell-induced expression of TPO receptor (TPO-R) on T-cells and effects of its activation on T-cell responses. CLL cell involvement in TPO generation was also assessed. Baseline TPO-R expression on CD4 + T-cells was found to be higher in CLL patients than in healthy controls (HC). Exposure of HC-T-cells to B-cells, especially to CLL-B-cells stimulated with B-cell activating molecules, resulted in enhanced TPO-R expression on T-cells. CLL-T-cell stimulation with TPO reduced their proliferation and expanded the regulatory T-cell (Treg) population. At baseline, phosphorylation of STAT5, known to impact the Treg phenotype, was elevated in CLL-T-cells relative to those of HC. Exposure to TPO further enhanced STAT5 phosphorylation in CLL-T-cells, possibly driving the observed Treg expansion. The CLL immune milieu is involved in promotion of inhibitory features in T-cells through increased TPO-R levels and TPO-induced intracellular signaling. TPO and its signaling pathway could potentially support immunosuppression in CLL, and may emerge as novel therapeutic targets."

We conducted a phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in Japanese patients with primary ITP. Thirty-four patients were randomised to fostamatinib (n = 22) or placebo (n = 12) at 100-150 mg twice a day for 24 weeks. Stable responses (platelet ≥50 000/μl at ≥4 of the 6 visits from weeks 14 to 24) were observed in eight (36%) patients on fostamatinib and in none of the patients on placebo (p = 0.030). Overall responses (platelet ≥50 000/μl at ≥1 of the 6 visits from weeks 2 to 12) were seen in 10 (45%) patients on fostamatinib and in none of the patients on placebo (p = 0.006). Patients on fostamatinib required rescue medication less often and experienced fewer bleeding symptoms than patients on placebo. Adverse events observed were mild or moderate and were manageable. No new safety signals were identified in Japanese patients with ITP."
36469708,Progress on the efficacy and potential mechanisms of rapamycin in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia.,"The complex pathogenesis of relapsed and refractory (R/R) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) contributes to the varied efficacy and tolerability of current treatment regimens. Rapamycin, an immunomodulatory agent, was originally used in the prevention of organ rejection after organ transplantation. Additional evidence now shows that rapamycin can successfully treat R/R ITP. Here, we summarize recent clinical progress on the role and potential mechanism of rapamycin in the treatment of ITP.
PubMed, Web of Science and CNKI database were searched to identify eligible studies, and the clinical data and preclinical studies on the use of mTOR inhibitors in ITP treatment were reviewed. The key results (efficacy and safety) of the most recent clinical reports were summarized.
Case series provide evidence of the effectiveness and tolerable safety profile of rapamycin in ITP, including primary and some secondary ITP. Mechanistic explorations indicate that rapamycin can regulate immune cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Breg, MDSC, etc.), modulate cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, BAFF, etc.) and promote platelet autophagy.
Emerging clinical data and basic studies suggest that rapamycin, as a multifaceted regulator, could provide a new promising option for the therapy of ITP. Additional research is needed to identify those patients which may benefit the most, as well as therapeutic regimens with which rapamycin may be combined."

36455965,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a multi-centre ECCO CONFER case series.,"Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is an acquired haematological disorder with an incidence of 1 to 6 per 100,000/year. ITP and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comorbidity has been reported in the literature, but insights regarding the course, outcome and optimal management are limited by its rarity. The current study aimed to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcome of ITP in patients with IBD.
This multicentre retrospective case series was performed as part of the ECCO Collaborative Network of Exceptionally Rare case reports (CONFER) project. Cases of patients with ITP and IBD were collected by participating investigators. Clinical data were recorded in a standardised collection form.
This report includes 32 patients with concurrent ITP and IBD:10 were females, median age was 32.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 20.5-39.5]. 14 patients had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) and the other 18 had of ulcerative colitis (UC). The diagnosis of IBD preceded the ITP in 26 patients (median time between diagnoses was 7.0 years [IQR, 1.5-9.5]). Among those patients, 17 patients were in clinical remission at ITP diagnosis. 13 patients were treated with mesalamine, 4 with oral corticosteroids, 1 with rectal corticosteroids, 2 with azathioprine, and 5 with anti-TNF agents. The median platelet count was 35,000/mmc (IQR, 10,000-70,000). 8 patients had rectal bleeding, 13 had skin purpura, 3 had epistaxis, 6 had mucosal petechiae, and 13 were asymptomatic. Regarding ITP treatment, 19 were treated with corticosteroids, 1 with Anti-RhD immunoglobulin, 12 with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), 4 with thrombopoietin, 3 with rituximab and 6 patients eventually required splenectomy. 10 patients needed no treatment directed to the ITP.Three patients required colectomy during term long follow-up, due to IBD or cancer and not to massive bleeding as a complication of ITP. One patient of eight patients who presented with rectal bleeding required splenectomy, and none required urgent colectomy. Two patients died during the follow-up, one of them due to bleeding complication located in the upper gastrointestinal tract.Median follow-up time was 6.5 years [IQR, 3-10]. With long-term follow-up, all patients had platelet count above 50,000/mmc, and 24 were in IBD clinical remission.
Most ITP cases in this case series occurred after the IBD diagnosis and responded well to regular ITP treatment. The course of the ITP in the IBD patients follows an expected course, including response to medical therapy and low rates of splenectomy."
36453103,Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura plasmas induce calcium- and IgG-dependent endothelial activation: correlations with disease severity.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is characterized by a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency due to the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, with subsequent accumulation of circulating ultra-large von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. The role of endothelial cell activation as a trigger of the disease has been suggested in animal models but remains to be demonstrated in humans. We prospectively obtained plasma from the first plasma exchange of 25 patients during iTTP acute phase. iTTP but not control plasma, induced a rapid VWF release and P-selectin exposure on dermal human micro-vascular endothelial cell (HMVEC-d) surface, associated with angiopoietin-2 and endothelin-1 secretion, consistent with Weibel-Palade bodies exocytosis. Calcium (Ca2+) blockade significantly decreased VWF release, whereas iTTP plasma induced a rapid and sustained Ca2+ flux in HMVEC-d which correlated in retrospect, with disease severity and survival in 62 iTTP patients. F(ab)'2 fragments purified from the immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction of iTTP plasma mainly induced endothelial cell (EC) activation with additional minor roles for circulating free heme and nucleosomes, but not for complement. Furthermore, two anti-ADAMTS13 monoclonal antibodies purified from iTTP patient B cells, but not serum from hereditary TTP, induced endothelial Ca2+ flux associated with Weibel-Palade bodies exocytosis in vitro, whereas inhibition of endothelial ADAMTS13 expression using small interference RNA, significantly decreased the stimulating effects of iTTP IgG. In conclusion, Ca2+-mediated endothelial cell activation constitutes a second ""hit"" of iTTP, is correlated with the severity of the disease and may constitute a possible therapeutic target."

The seroconversion rate for ITP patients was 91.3%, comparable to that in healthy controls (HCs). However, the antibody titre in ITP patients was significantly lower than that in HCs and declined with ageing. Furthermore, the antibody titre in ITP patients who received a minimum prednisolone dose of at least 5 mg/day at any time-point at or after initial vaccination was lower than that in other patients."

However, the exact pathogenic mechanisms of their occurrence remain elusive. In this article, we aim to describe two cases of UC patients who developed refractory HES and ITP and elaborate on their potential pathogenesis.
We report two middle-aged patients diagnosed with UC. The first patient developed HES that was refractory to conventional medical therapy of idiopathic HES, and the second developed refractory ITP that failed steroid and immunosuppressive therapy. Both conditions improved considerably following colectomy, suggesting they are of a reactive rather than idiopathic nature.
In patients with UC and refractory comorbid HES or ITP, the reactive nature of these comorbidities should be taken into consideration, and colectomy, therefore, should be considered if clinically indicated."

This prospective, open-label phase 2/3 study evaluated caplacizumab 10 mg administered daily during plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward, in combination with immunosuppressive treatment, in Japanese adults with a clinical diagnosis of iTTP (new or recurrent). The primary endpoint was prevention of iTTP recurrence; key secondary endpoints included time to platelet count response, time to organ damage normalization, and safety. Among 21 treated patients, 1 of 15 (6.7%) evaluable patients developed iTTP recurrence. Median time to normalization was 2.79 days for platelet count and 2.65 days for organ damage markers (n = 15). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild to moderate in severity; the most frequently reported caplacizumab-related TEAEs were increased alanine aminotransferase, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (all in 9.5% of patients). At least one bleeding event was reported in 7 of 21 patients (33%). Caplacizumab was effective in Japanese patients with iTTP, with a low rate of iTTP recurrence, rapid normalization of platelet counts and organ damage markers, and no unexpected TEAEs.

36424271,Current approaches for the diagnosis and management of immune thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of platelets and megakaryocytes, resulting in thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × 10⁹/L). This review focuses on the diagnosis and current management of ITP. The diagnosis of ITP is based principally on the exclusion of other causes of isolated thrombocytopenia using patient history, physical examination, blood count, and evaluation of the peripheral blood film. The clinical treatment goals should be to resolve bleeding events and to prevent severe bleeding episodes. The platelet count should be improved to attain a minimum of > 20-30 × 10⁹/L. Therapy should be given as an inpatient in newly diagnosed ITP with a platelet count of > 20 × 10⁹/L or if there is active bleeding. Corticosteroids are considered the standard initial treatment for newly diagnosed patients. Subsequent medical therapies with robust evidence include thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), rituximab and fostamatinib. Surgical therapy with splenectomy may be considered for patients failing medical therapy. The choice between therapy options is highly dependent upon patient values and preferences."

36419571,Splenectomy in patients with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) appears to be protective against developing aortic valve disease.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been shown to be independently associated with aortic valve disease (AVD). However, whether ITP patients who have undergone splenectomy are also at increased risk for AVD has not been researched. The goal of this study was to evaluate any association between AVD and splenectomy in patients with ITP.
We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2005 to 2014 as 10 consecutive years randomly selected. Using ICD-9 codes for AVD, ITP, and splenectomy, a total of 108,434 patients were identified with ITP, 4,282 of which had undergone splenectomy. We performed uni- and multivariate analysis adjusting for baseline characteristics.
Univariate analysis revealed a significantly lower rate of AVD in ITP patients with splenectomy compared to no splenectomy in 2007, 2009, and 2010 with a trend of this association during the other years. For example, in 2007, 0.6% of ITP patients with history of splenectomy had AVD versus 2.0% of ITP patients without splenectomy (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.91; 
Based on a large inpatient database, our previous finding of ITP patients' association with AVD is only present in patients without splenectomy, and splenectomy appears to exert a protective effect on developing aortic valve disease in ITP patients, warranting further investigation."

36408739,Why should intramuscular anti-D be different from intravenous anti-D?,"For reasons of safety the use of intravenous anti D to treat ITP has largely been abandoned because of the risk it incurs of intravascular haemolysis. Intramuscular delivery of anti-D could be a safer approach and deserves to be further evaluated. IV anti-D was a mainstay of ITP treatment in the United States in the 1990's until the development of intravascular hemolysis (IVH) and its serious even fatal consequences was appreciated. Subsequently, treatment of patients with ITP with IV anti-D has become very rare given other alternatives and the IVH risk. IM anti-D does not carry a risk for IVH and it should be re-evaluated and reconsidered as an option for D+ DAT-negative not splenectomized adults who do not have a long duration of ITP and require maintenance treatment.

36407259,Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Paradoxical Thrombosis: A Systematic Review of Case Reports.," Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired bleeding disorder characterized by autoantibodies against platelets. The clinical presentation is variable; the main symptom is bleeding, and many patients are asymptomatic; others have nonspecific symptoms like fatigue. Uncommonly, ITP can present with paradoxical thrombosis. The risk of thrombosis in ITP may be higher than expected, which makes the management of ITP more challenging. This review aims to evaluate patients with ITP who develop thrombosis and identify potential risk factors related to thrombosis in this category of patients.
 English literature was searched using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for adults above 18 years with primary ITP who had infarctions or thrombotic events. Patients with secondary ITP were excluded. The search included articles published up to 20th October 2021.
 A total of 73 articles were included. Seventy-seven patients with ITP had developed infarctions and various thrombotic events. Sixty-three patients had arterial events, and 14 patients developed venous thrombotic events.
 Patients with ITP have low platelets, which predispose them to bleed; despite that, serious thrombotic complications can happen in these patients and are difficult to predict. Therefore, it is critical for physicians to understand that ITP is paradoxically a prothrombotic condition and to address preventive thromboembolic measures whenever possible."
36406096,Trauma-related oral lesions; Angina bullosa haemorrhagica: a rare case presentation.,"Angina bullosa haemorrhgica is a relatively uncommon condition characterized by blood-filled subepithelial lesions in the oral mucosa that is idiopathic and not caused by a systemic disease or a hemostatic abnormality. Middle-aged and elderly patients are usually affected and lesions heal spontaneously without scarring. A rapidly expanding hemorrhagic blister in the oropharynx can induce upper airway obstruction, so recognizing the lesion as soon as possible is essential. Because of its rarity, we wanted to highlight a 42-year-old male patient who presented with hemorrhagic bullae associated with insignificant local trauma in the oral mucosa and to emphasize that Angina bullosa haemorrhagica is a rare but recognizable lesion that clinicians should be aware of."
36405818,Purpura with regular shape in an adolescent: Beware of dermatitis artefacta.,"Purpura is common in pediatric patients, mostly diagnosed as IgA-related vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). However, in some cases, for example, cases with dermatitis artefacta, it could puzzle a physician or pediatrician for a long time, with great challenges in diagnosis.
We present the case of a 13-year-old boy with recurrent painful purpura on both upper limbs. The physical exam was unremarkable, except for right blepharoptosis and scars from burns. The diagnostic tests were normal. Through repeated communication, the patient was finally diagnosed as having dermatitis artefacta, accompanied by underlying psychological problems.
Before dermatitis artefacta was diagnosed, we spent a lot of money and effort on the diagnosis. Therefore, in order to determine the diagnosis as soon as possible and save on unnecessary medical expenses, we propose a rapid process for the diagnosis of purpura of dermatitis artefacta in children."

Prolonged headaches and cutaneous hemorrhages, frequently observed after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, have therefore caused anxiety among vaccinees. We investigated whether these symptoms represent a mild form of VITT, with a potential for aggravation, e.g. in case of a second vaccination dose, or a different entity of vaccine complications MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included previously healthy individuals who had a combination of headache and spontaneous severe cutaneous hemorrhages emerging after the 1
None of the symptomatic vaccinees had cerebral vein thrombosis, hemorrhage or other pathology on MRI. Platelet counts were within normal range and no anti-PF4/polyanion platelet activating antibodies were found. Moreover, vasculitis markers, platelet activation markers and thrombin generation were normal. Furthermore, almost all symptoms resolved, and none had recurrence of symptoms after further vaccination with mRNA vaccines against Covid-19.
The combination of headaches and subcutaneous hemorrhage did not represent VITT and no other specific coagulation disorder or intracranial pathology was found. However, symptoms initially mimicking VITT demand vigilance and low threshold for a clinical evaluation combined with platelet counts and D-dimer."
36396570,Plasma Cell Directed Therapy for Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (iTTP).,"Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) underpinned by autoreactivity against the von Willebrand factor (vWF) cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). Autoantibody mediated ADAMTS13 inhibition leads to the accumulation of ultra-large vWF multimers which activate platelets and endothelium to initiate microvascular thrombosis. In the absence of urgent therapeutic intervention, iTTP is rapidly fatal due to cumulative organ dysfunction including catastrophic neurological and cardiac sequalae. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is the mainstay of initial therapy and aims to remove pathological autoantibodies and ultra-large vWF multimers while replenishing ADAMTS13. Immunosuppression is an important treatment adjunct, as attainment of remission and successful TPE cessation is strongly associated with suppression of anti-ADAMTS13 antibody production. More recently, caplacizumab, an antibody fragment blocking the interaction between vWF multimers and platelets, has been incorporated into acute TTP management to mitigate end-organ damage while awaiting suppression of anti-ADAMTS13 activity. In most cases, remission is achieved using corticosteroids alone or in combination with the B-cell depleting antibody, rituximab. However, some patients are refractory to front-line immunosuppression in the context of 'inhibitor boosting' whereby the exposure to homologous plasma exacerbates the underlying autoimmune flare. As such cases have been observed in the context of likely effective B-cell depletion, it has been hypothesized that plasma cells (ie, terminally differentiated B-cells) may provide a therapy-resistant nidus of anti-ADAMTS13 production as has been demonstrated in other autoimmune disease settings. Autoreactive plasma cells can be targeted by conventional and novel therapeutics, including those developed for malignant plasma cells in the context of multiple myeloma. Here we review the rationale and evidence for plasma cell directed therapy in refractory iTTP, with a focus on the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, and the CD38 monoclonal antibody, daratumumab."
36396166,Epistaxis duration predicts bleeding in immune thrombocytopenia: a cohort study.,"To test for an association between duration of epistaxis and clinically relevant bleeding in the following 12 months in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).
Prospective cohort study.
The national UK Paediatric ITP registry, a multicentre prospective clinical registry of new cases of ITP between 2006 and February 2020.
All children aged between 2 months and 16 years in participating UK centres.
Epistaxis at presentation defined as none, <10 min, 10-30 min and >30 min.
Incident severe bleeds, combined moderate and severe bleeds and drop in haemoglobin (Hb) by ≥20 g/L.
The sample included 1793 patients, of which 334 had epistaxis <10 min, 88 lasting 10-30 min and 97 >30 min. In the 12 months following presentation, 19 had a severe bleed, 140 had a moderate bleed and 54 had a drop in Hb ≥2 g/dL. Epistaxis >30 min duration was associated with increased odds of severe bleeds (OR 1.43-15.67), moderate or severe bleeding (OR 1.33-4.2) and drop in Hb (OR 1.23-6.91). Shorter duration epistaxis was not associated with increased odds of any outcome. A trend for increased odds with longer duration epistaxis was significant for all outcomes.
The longer the duration of epistaxis at presentation with ITP, the higher the risk of a clinically significant bleeding event in the 12 months following. This should inform clinical severity ratings and treatment decisions."

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy (response rate) of high dose dexamethasone with conventional prednisolone in the treatment of newly diagnosed adult patients of Immune thrombocytopenic purpura. It was a prospective quasi-experimental study, conducted at the Department of Medicine of a tertiary care hospital from Jan to Dec 2019.
The sample population comprised of 130 cases of newly diagnosed ITP patients, having platelet count <30,000/ul with or without bleeding symptoms who received either dexamethasone (40 mg/day for 04 days) or prednisolone (0.5-1 mg/kg PSL for 01 week). Treatment response was measured at day 7.
Out of 130 patients 65 patients were treated with dexamethasone and 65 patients with prednisolone .83.08% (n=54) cases in Group-A and 33.85% (n=22) in Group-B had response while remaining 16.92% (n=11) in Group-A and 66.15% (n=43) in Group-B had no response. The p value was calculated as 0.000 which shows a significant difference.
We concluded that high dose of dexamethasone shows a significantly higher response when compared with conventional prednisolone in the treatment of newly diagnosed adult patients of Immune thrombocytopenia purpura."
36369088,Heat shock protein-70 is elevated in childhood primary immune thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of the platelets resulting from autoimmune recognition and subsequent attack. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are directly associated with progression and pathogenesis in some specific autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum expression of HSP-70 in ITP children and healthy controls.
A total of 86 children aged 1-6 years were enrolled in the study. The participants were divided into 20 newly diagnosed ITP (ndITP), 34 chronic ITP (cITP) patients and 32 healthy children. The white blood cells and platelet counts were determined and compared between the groups. HSP-70 serum levels were analyzed by sandwich ELISA. Data analysis was done using SPSS and the data variables assessment was done through histogram, probability plots and Shapiro-Wilk tests to determine normal distribution.
The white blood cell counts were 8.9 (4.2-10.4) for new diagnosis ITP, 7.1(3.9-11.9) for the chronic ITP group and 7.0 (4.3-9.5) for the healthy controls. The platelet counts were significantly increased in the chronic ITP group, 83.5(31.7-297) compared to the ndITP group 27.4 (3.7-63.7), but significantly lower compared to the healthy controls 271(172-462) (P = 0.0009). There were significantly increased HSP-70 serum levels in cITP patients compared to the ndITP and the healthy group. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the serum HSP-70 level and the thrombocyte counts among the ITP children.
HSP-70 has a role in the progression of childhood ITP. Increased HSP-70 level is associated with the severity of childhood primary ITP."
36368692,From the Discovery of ADAMTS13 to Current Understanding of Its Role in Health and Disease.,"ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin-like metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) is a protease of crucial importance in the regulation of the size of von Willebrand factor multimers. Very low ADAMTS13 activity levels result in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a rare and life-threatening disease. The mechanisms involved can either be acquired (immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [iTTP]) or congenital (cTTP, Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) caused by the autosomal recessive inheritance of disease-causing variants (DCVs) located along the "

Here, we report on data from a single-center retrospective-prospective collection aiming to evaluate platelet (plt) dynamics in patients (pts) with chronic ITP after COVID-19 infection (before and after vaccination) and after the first, second and third vaccine doses. Furthermore, we analyzed the serological response after the first two doses of COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 64 pts currently followed for chronic ITP who experienced COVD-19 infection and/or vaccination with an available plt count before and after such events were included in the analysis. A low incidence of ITP exacerbation following vaccine sessions (6-16%) was observed in comparison with a high frequency of exacerbation and rescue treatment necessity after COVID-19 infection in unvaccinated pts (83%). Moreover, the lower ITP exacerbation rate observed in infected pts previously vaccinated (18%) suggests further protective effects in this population. Finally, a high seroconversion rate was observed, confirming data reported in previously published studies on immune cytopenia and rheumatological diseases, but more evidence is awaited to establish the clinical impact of serological response."

36345812,Evaluating the impact of thrombopoietin receptor agonist medications on patient outcomes and quality of life in paediatric immune thrombocytopenia through semi-structured interviews.,"Over the last decade, treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children has advanced to include thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) medications. Concurrently, there has been an increased emphasis on patient-reported outcomes-especially quality of life-to guide treatment. Assessing the impact of TPO-RAs on quality of life in paediatric ITP is therefore a priority. In this single-centre integrative mixed-methods study, a cohort of children with ITP prescribed a TPO-RA was identified. These children and/or their caregivers were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews focussed on quality-of-life measures. Independently, a retrospective chart review collected ITP-related data (platelet count, bleeding events) and TPO-RA data (dosing, side effects). Among the 23 eligible patients, 20 were represented in interviews. On chart review, 11/20 patients responded to TPO-RA by meeting platelet count criteria of ≥50 × 10"
36331249,"Recent advances in understanding spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in human biology and disease, with a focus on fostamatinib.","Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is an important regulatory molecule of signal transduction pathways involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and the SYK-signaling pathway has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of numerous diseases. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the biological properties of SYK and its involvement in disease pathways, provide an update on SYK inhibitors in the treatment of ITP, and consider other potential applications. Fostamatinib, the only licensed SYK inhibitor to date, produces clinical response in ITP patients, including those who are refractory to other treatments. It appears to reduce the risk of thrombotic events and may therefore be a drug to consider for patients with an increased thrombotic risk. Encouraging results have also been obtained in the treatment of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Several other SYK inhibitors have entered clinical trials for a range of indications, reflecting the ability of these drugs to affect multiple signaling pathways. SYK inhibitors have the potential to target several aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis including thrombosis, without affecting normal hemostasis, and data from the first study of fostamatinib in COVID-19 are encouraging. It is hoped that ongoing trials in autoimmune indications other than ITP, as well as in hematological malignancies and other disorders, confirm the promise of SYK inhibitors.
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that usually happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, which are cells that help blood to clot. Individuals with ITP can experience easy or excessive bruising and bleeding. Scientists have identified that an enzyme called spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is involved in numerous biological processes that are associated with the immune system response, inflammation, and some types of cancer in humans. Therefore, it has become a target for new drugs which inhibit the action of SYK. In this review article, the authors provide a summary of the biological properties and actions of SYK and its involvement in various diseases, discuss information about drugs that have been developed as SYK inhibitors for the treatment of ITP, and consider other potential uses for drugs that inhibit SYK. Although several drugs are being developed, the only SYK inhibitor that is currently available for the treatment of ITP is a drug called fostamatinib. In patients with ITP, including those who no longer respond to other treatments, fostamatinib has been shown to improve platelet counts and reduce bleeding events. Researchers are also currently investigating the use of drugs that inhibit SYK, including fostamatinib, for the potential treatment of other diseases associated with inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, COVID-19), autoimmunity (e.g. warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia), and blood cancers (e.g. lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia)."
36327915,Relapses of Immune Thrombocytopenia after the Second and Booster Doses of BNT162b2 Vaccine.,"We present here a 65-year-old male patient known for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and fluctuating platelet count who experienced a severe exacerbation of thrombocytopenia following BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. One month after the second dose, he presented petechiae and asthenia with isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 3 × 109/L). He recovered after a 4-day course of intravenous corticosteroid treatment and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Eight months later, his platelet count was within the normal range, and he received a booster dose of vaccine after premedication with prednisone. Eight days later, his platelet count dropped to 29 × 109/L, but he remained asymptomatic. He received a rescue treatment with prednisone followed by rituximab over 4 weeks, allowing progressive improvement. Our case suggests a strong association between COVID-19 vaccination and the exacerbation of ITP."

The expression level of CD72 in B lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry in 18 ITP patients and 19 controls of healthy donor or iron-deficiency anemia patients. B cell proliferation was determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation (BrdU) in the culture of 17 ITP patients' and 11 controls' peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs). The secretion levels of antibodies against human platelet antigens (HPA), as well as B cell proliferation-related cytokine interleukin 1(IL-1) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA.
CD72 was significantly increased in B cells of newly diagnosed or persistent ITP compared with ITP in remission. B cell proliferation in culture with CD72 antibody addition was significantly decreased both in ITP patients and in controls compared with isotype antibody addition. CD72 antibody did not significantly alter HPA antibody level in ITP patients. CD72 antibody increased IL-1 and MIF levels in ITP patients' cell culture supernatant but not in controls.
CD72 expression elevation accompanies the active status of ITP. "
36322971,Long-term risk of relapse in immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the role of anti-CD20 therapy.,"Disease relapse is recognized as a risk in immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) after treatment of the acute presenting episode. Identification of patients at risk of relapse and its patterns are yet to be clearly established. We reviewed patients with iTTP having had >3 years of follow-up over 10 years in the United Kingdom to identify patient characteristics for relapse, assess relapse rates and patterns, and response to anti-CD20 therapy in those with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) relapses (ADAMTS13 activity of <20% without thrombocytopenia). We identified 443 patients demonstrating relapse rates of 40% at 5-year follow-up. At 10-year follow-up, no difference in relapse was observed irrespective of whether rituximab was used at acute presentation (P = .39). Black Caribbean ethnicity increased the risk of disease relapse in the British population. There was a distinct population of patients (6%) that relapsed early with subsequent frequent relapses occurring on average within 2 years (average time to relapse in subgroup, 1.7 years). Overall, nearly 60% of relapses described were ADAMTS13 relapses, with subsequent treatment reducing the risk of progression to clinical relapses. We demonstrate that iTTP diagnosed in the latter part of the study period had lower rates of clinical relapses (22.6% vs 11.1%, P = .0004) with the advent of regular monitoring and preemptive rituximab. In ADAMTS13 relapses, 96% responded to anti-CD20 therapy, achieving ADAMTS13 activity of >20%. Anti-CD20 therapy was demonstrated to be an effective long-term treatment regardless of relapse pattern and there was no loss of this treatment response after subsequent treatment episodes."
36320952,Oculomotor Nerve Palsy as a Manifestation of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A Case Report.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is caused by alterations in the immune system resulting in platelet destruction. It often manifests clinically with bleeding or on routine lab work revealing thrombocytopenia in asymptomatic individuals. Neurologic manifestations of this condition are sparsely documented in the literature. Among the symptoms reported were case reports of ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, mononeuropathy multiplex, and polyneuropathy as neurological complications from immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Isolated cranial nerve palsies are uncommon. The following case describes a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura who presented with an isolated cranial nerve III palsy.

Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines impact platelet counts and bleeding in children, adolescents, and young adults (C-AYA) with preexisting ITP is unknown. We report here the very limited effect of COVID-19 vaccination on platelet counts and bleeding in a single-center series of 2 C-AYA with ITP. No patient experienced worsening bleeding and only one child had a significant decrease in platelet count which improved spontaneously to her baseline without intervention. SARS-CoV2 vaccination was safe in C-AYA with ITP in this small cohort."
36306339,ADAMTS13 conformation and immunoprofiles in Japanese patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an ultrarare thrombotic disease caused by autoantibody-induced ADAMTS13 deficiency. Open ADAMST13 conformation, induced by autoantibodies, was identified as a novel biomarker for iTTP. Determining immunoprofiles in patients with iTTP has been shown to guide the development of novel targeted therapies. However, these studies were done in mainly Caucasian iTTP cohorts. To validate those findings across other ethnic cohorts, we investigated 195 acute TTP plasma samples from the Japanese iTTP registry. Seventy-six of the 195 samples had detectable ADAMTS13 antigen levels, of which 94.7% were shown to have an open ADAMTS13 conformation. A positive correlation was observed between ADAMTS13 inhibitor titers (a diagnostic parameter in Japan) and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G autoantibody titers. Studying anti-M, anti-DT, anti-CS, anti-T2-T5, anti-T6-T8, anti-CUB1-2 autoantibodies and the corresponding immunoprofile showed that 73% of the patients had anti-CS autoantibodies and 25.8% had anti-M autoantibodies, with the latter being higher than in Caucasians. Stratifying patients according to their immunoprofiles revealed that the profile with only anti-CS autoantibodies was the most common immunoprofile similar to that in Caucasians (28.9%). Although this profile did not affect the 1-year TTP-related mortality rate, patients with autoantibodies against all 6 ADAMTS13 fragments had a higher risk for TTP-related death than other patients (P = .02). We here validated open ADAMTS13 as a novel biomarker for acute iTTP and determined the dominant immunoprofiling in the Japanese cohort, contributing to setting up the diagnosis and managing guidelines across different ethnic cohorts and developing ADAMTS13 variants that do not bind to the anti-CS autoantibodies."

36287218,Health Following Recovery from Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: The Patient's Perspective.,"The impact of residual symptoms following recovery from immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) on activities of daily living during remission is not routinely discussed or evaluated by hematologists. This study utilized qualitative methodology to understand three issues from the patient's perspective: the most important symptoms during remission, the impact of these symptoms on their daily activities and the effectiveness of communication with hematologists.
Oklahoma and Ohio patients participated in either focus groups or individual interviews. Eligibility included age >18 years, ADAMTS13 deficiency (<10% activity) at diagnosis or relapse and in clinical remission (> one year from episode). A non-probabilistic purposive sampling approach was utilized. Most important symptoms were defined as symptoms mentioned across all seven focus groups. The interviews supplemented focus group data. Analysis focused on describing the impact of symptoms and barriers to communicating with hematologists.
Forty-four patients participated (focus groups, N=25; interviews, N=19). The most important symptoms affecting the patients' daily activities were cognitive issues, anxiety, depression and fatigue. These symptoms impacted patients' ability to return to their previous level of functioning and created difficulties in relationships. A key communication barrier with their hematologists was forgetting to mention these symptoms.
Although hematologists pronounce patients as recovered, iTTP remains a life-changing event. Patients often did not return to their previous functioning; relationships and their careers were affected. However, patients may forget to discuss these concerns with their hematologist. To improve remission care, hematologists should incorporate patient-reported outcome measures evaluating these symptoms in remission visits."
36284639,Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and COVID-19: Impacts of vaccination and infection in this rare disease.,"Severe COVID-19 is associated with an important increase of von Willebrand factor and mild lowering of ADAMTS13 activity that may, in the presence of a strong inflammatory reaction, increase the risk of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Although acute episodes of immune-mediated TTP associated with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported, data about clinical evolution of hereditary TTP (hTTP) during the pandemic are scarce.
We conducted a survey among adult patients of the International Hereditary TTP Registry about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, COVID-19, and occurrence of acute hTTP episodes.
Of 122 adult hTTP patients invited to participate, 86 (70.5%) responded. Sixty-five had been vaccinated (75.6%), of which 14 had received in addition a booster, resulting in 139 individual vaccine shots. Although vaccinations in patients on plasma prophylaxis were done within 1 week of the last plasma infusion, all 23 patients treated with plasma on demand were vaccinated without prior plasma infusions. One patient on uninterrupted weekly plasma infusions presented within 3 days from his second vaccination with neurological symptoms and computed tomography scan 9 days later showed subacute ischemic/hemorrhagic frontal lobe infarction. A second male patient developed acute myocarditis after his second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Twelve (14%) patients had COVID-19, associated with an acute hTTP episode in three of them: one patient had a transient ischemic attack, one a stroke, and a pregnant woman was hospitalized to intensify plasma treatment.
The risk of an acute episode triggered by COVID-19 seems higher than following vaccination in hTTP patients, who can be safely vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2."
36281771,Eltrombopag modulates the phenotypic evolution and potential immunomodulatory roles of monocytes/macrophages in immune thrombocytopenia.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune hemorrhagic disease. Loss of immune tolerance plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ITP. Monocytes and macrophages play an indispensable role in the pathophysiology of hematopoietic malignancies and have been implicated as key players in platelet destruction. Approximately 80% of adult patients with ITP exhibit corticosteroid treatment failure or become dependent, requiring novel therapy. Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) have been used clinically to manage ITP effectively, however, little is known about the effect of TPO-RAs on monocyte and macrophage modulation in adult ITP. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic evolution and potential immunomodulatory roles of monocytes/macrophages in ITP patients receiving eltrombopag therapy. Results showed that the peripheral monocyte count positively correlated with IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio in ITP patients. Moreover, numerous phenotype-associated genes in ITP macrophages exhibited diverse responses, and ITP macrophages exhibited more M1-related characteristics. After eltrombopag therapy, the peripheral monocyte count and IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio significantly decreased in ITP patients. M1-related characteristics of ITP macrophages were partially reversed by eltrombopag. Therefore, this study revealed eltrombopag restored the monocyte dynamics and the associated Th1/Th2 imbalance, and partially reversed the M1-related characteristics of the ITP macrophages, which suggest the potential vital roles of TPO-RAs in regulating the monocyte/macrophage plasticity in ITP."
36273985,Safety and efficacy of romiplostim in children and adolescents with Immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of romiplostim (thrombopoietin-receptor agonist) in the treatment of pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).
Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov (from January 2011 to August 2021). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), double-blind, comparing romiplostim with a placebo in pediatric persistent or chronic ITP were included. The primary outcome was the overall response rate (platelets ≥ 50 × 10
Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials (84 participants) were included in this systematic review. Our data showed that, compared to the placebo group, the proportion of patients achieving durable platelet response was significantly higher in the romiplostim group (p = 0.003, RR = 6.34, 95%CI = 1.89 - 21.23), as was the overall response in the romiplostim group (p = 0.002, RR = 3.62, 95%CI = 1.63 - 8.03). Significant bleeding incidents (p = 0.49), overall adverse events (p = 0.71) and the need for rescue treatment (p = 0.13) were not statistically different between the romiplostim and placebo groups.
Romiplostim might improve both durable and overall platelet response in children and adolescents with ITP, compared to a placebo. More clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of romiplostim and to compare it with other second-line treatments that are being used in pediatric ITP."
36273934,Changing Paradigms in ITP Management: Newer Tools for an Old Disease.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia that may be accompanied clinically by bleeding and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While corticosteroids, splenectomy, and various immunosuppressants (used off-label) have served as historical mainstays of ITP treatment, their use is associated with adverse effects and morbidity. Over the last 15 years, the advent of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists has revolutionized the management of chronic ITP with high response rates, durable responses, and minimal adverse effects in most patients. With four agents now FDA-approved to manage chronic ITP, there is a renewed emphasis on improving HRQoL and minimizing the toxicities associated with traditional therapies. Promising agents with diverse mechanisms of action, ranging from those targeting Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase to the neonatal Fc receptor, are currently under investigation. This review highlights recent landmark clinical trials which have made significant impacts on ITP management and ongoing drug development. In critically analyzing studies of relevance, we illustrate the changing paradigms of ITP management and how the field is advancing beyond traditional therapies."
36271897,Preemptive cyclosporin A in immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Survivors of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) are exposed to clinical relapses when a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) activity decreases during follow-up. Although preemptive rituximab usually improves ADAMTS13 activity in this context, 15% of patients experience refractoriness or intolerance to rituximab and require alternative strategies. Here, we addressed whether cyclosporine A (CSA) could improve ADAMTS13 activity and prevent clinical relapses in this context. We treated preemptively with CSA 14 iTTP patients who were unresponsive (n = 11) or intolerant (n = 3) to rituximab. All patients had a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity <20%) and otherwise in clinical remission. ADAMTS13 activity normalized in almost all patients (n = 13, 93%), after a median time of 2.5 months [IQR 1-6] following initiation. Median duration of CSA treatment was 17.5 months [IQR 10-34]. ADAMTS13 activity further declined to undetectable values during follow-up in five patients, but retreatment with rituximab or CSA allowed a recovery in ADAMTS13 activity in three cases. CSA could be stopped durably in two patients, while two others experienced an ADAMTS13 relapse. Severe but reversible side effects requiring cessation of the treatment occurred in two patients. CSA provides high and sustained response rates in patients who are refractory or intolerant to rituximab, with acceptable adverse events."

36267749,Sheng-Xue-Xiao-Ban Capsule-induced ischemic colitis and pulmonary embolism in an idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura patient: a rare case report.,"Sheng-Xue-Xiao-Ban Capsule (SXXBC), as a classic Chinese traditional medicine comprised of natural indigo, cortex moutan, forsythia, herba agrimoniae, and licorice, exhibits a heat-clearing and detoxicating function, hemostasis, and stasis dissipation, which is widely applied to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However, report on ischemic colitis and pulmonary embolism induced by SXXBC therapy is never disclosed. We report the case of an ITP patient who received SXXBC for ascending platelets that then induced ischemic colitis and pulmonary embolism.
A 74-year-old female patient was admitted in June 2021 due to ""bleeding in stool for 1 day,"" she was then re-admitted in July 2021 due to ""repeated bleeding in stool for 2 days"". Abdominal computed tomography (CT), colonoscopy, and a pathological examination suggested ischemic colitis according to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guidelines. Pulmonary artery CT angiography suggested pulmonary embolism reflected by multiple filling defects, and the patient presented with shortness of breath. It was noted that the patient had started taken SXXBC for ascending platelets 2 months before the onset of hematochezia. After the diagnosis of hematochezia was made, the patient received phenethylamine and carbazochrome for hemostasis, mesalazine enteric-coated tablets for anti-inflammation, and SXXBC was stopped. The hematochezia then ceased, and the ischemic colitis was attenuated. Afterwards, low-molecular-weight heparin was administered, followed by a 3-week treatment of rivaroxaban anticoagulant, which was taken orally after discharge. The pulmonary embolism was then obviously ameliorated. After excluding other causes, the patient was diagnosed with SXXBC-induced ischemic colitis complicated by pulmonary embolism. After conducting research, we came to the view that natural indigo, which is the main component of SXXBC, contributed to the patient's illness.
Ischemic colitis complicated with pulmonary embolism are rare; however, close attention such as regular abdominal CT test needs to be paid and preventive steps such as anti-coagulant treatment could to be taken (if symptoms occur) when treating patients with SXXBC."
36265409,Vaccine-associated thrombocytopenia.,"Vaccination is the most cost-effective means of preventing and even eliminating infectious diseases. However, adverse reactions after vaccination are inevitable. In addition to common vaccine-related adverse reactions, some rare but serious adverse reactions have been reported, including secondary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is currently the only vaccine for which a cause-effect relationship with immune thrombocytopenia has been demonstrated with an incidence of approximately 0.087-4 per 100,000 doses, and the complication is mostly observed in children. In addition, thrombocytopenia can be induced by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines following COVID-19 vaccination primarily occurs within a few weeks post-vaccination. The condition mostly occurs in elderly individuals with no sex differences. Its incidence is approximately 0.80 to 11.3 per million doses. Some patients have previously suffered from chronic ITP likely to develop exacerbation of ITP after COVID-19 vaccines, especially those who have undergone splenectomy or are being treated with >5 medications. Based on clinical practice, first-line treatments for vaccine-associated thrombocytopenia are essentially limited to those used for primary ITP, including glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)."
36263841,Enhancing regulatory T-cell function via inhibition of high mobility group box 1 protein signaling in immune thrombocytopenia.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired autoimmune bleeding disorder. Abnormally increased levels of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein associate with thrombocytopenia and therapeutic outcome in ITP. Previous studies proposed that a natural inhibitor of HMGB1, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA), could be used for its anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects, although its ability to correct immune balance in ITP is unclear. In this study, we showed that plasma HMGB1 correlated negatively with platelet counts in ITP patients, and confirmed that 18β-GA stimulated the production of regulatory T cells (Treg), restored the balance of CD4+ T-cell subsets and enhanced the suppressive function of Treg through blocking the effect on HMGB1 in patients with ITP. HMGB1 short hairpin RNA interference masked the effect of 18β-GA in Treg of ITP patients. Furthermore, we found that 18β-GA alleviated thrombocytopenia in mice with ITP. Briefly, anti-CD61 immune-sensitized splenocytes were transferred into severe combined immunodeficient mice to induce a murine model of severe ITP. The proportion of circulating Treg increased significantly, while the level of plasma HMGB1 and serum antiplatelet antibodies decreased significantly in ITP mice along 18β-GA treatment. In addition, 18β-GA reduced phagocytic activity of macrophages towards platelets both in ITP patients and ITP mice. These results indicate that 18β-GA has the potential to restore immune balance in ITP via inhibition of HMGB1 signaling. In short, this study reveals the role of HMGB1 in ITP, which may serve as a potential target for thrombocytopenia therapy."
36261950,Splenectomy for wandering splenomegaly in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: A case report of a rare association.,"• The absence or malformations of splenic suspensory ligaments attaching the spleen to the diaphragm, colon, and retroperitoneum is the major cause of wandering spleen (WS). • Diagnosis is often an occasional finding during radiological exams. • Conservative treatment may lead to high complications. Thus, surgery with organopexy is the standard gold treatment. However, the preserving treatment is debatable in WS associated with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Wandering spleen (WS) is an uncommon congenital or acquired condition resulting from the absence or abnormal development of the spleen ligaments causing its outside position. WS has life-threatening complications ranging from torsion of the vascular pedicle to spleen infarction. In this paper, we report the use of open splenectomy in a female with an idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura history with WS.
We report a case of a 23-year-old nulliparous female with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. After complaining of chronic abdominal pain in the lower abdomen, the patient underwent an abdominopelvic ultrasound which showed a spleen of a pelvic seat at the size of 180 mm with homogeneous echo-structure and a free left spleen compartment. A complimentary computed tomography scan revealed ectopic splenomegaly (about 194 ∗ 62 ∗ 150 mm) in the pelvis with normal enhancement and no signs of infarction or torsion. A splenectomy was indicated due to the large spleen size and the patient's medical history. The postoperative course was uneventful. After the operation, an increase in the platelet count was registered, requiring aspirin administration to avoid thrombosis.
WS diagnosis should be considered whenever acute or chronic abdominal pain is associated with mobile abdominal or pelvic mass. Recognition of this disease is mandatory, and surgical management should not be delayed."

36257098,Treatment patterns and outcomes of second-line rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists in adult immune thrombocytopenia: A Canadian retrospective cohort study.,"The optimal choice of second-line treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is unclear. Guidelines recommend either rituximab, splenectomy, or thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA). There is, however, scarce data comparing treatment patterns, outcomes and resource utilization across second-line treatments. Despite Canada's universal healthcare system, publicly funded access to second-line ITP therapies is highly variable across provinces/territories.
To describe treatment patterns and compare health service utilization and outcomes among recipients of second-line rituximab and TPO-RA for ITP.
In this multicentre retrospective cohort study, we included adults who received second-line ITP therapies rituximab, eltrombopag and romiplostim (2012-2020) in Alberta, Canada. Patients were identified through a provincially-funded special drug access (STEDT) program. We examined treatment patterns, predictors of second-line treatment, hospitalizations, blood product utilization, and outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate the cumulative incidence of ITP-related hospitalizations (bleeding or infections), overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the impact of second-line therapy on OS.
223 patients received rituximab (67 %), eltrombopag (29 %), and romiplostim (4 %). TPO-RA recipients experienced significantly longer time from ITP diagnosis to second-line therapy compared with rituximab recipients (15.9 vs 6.7 months, P < 0.0001), accompanied by significantly higher platelet and IVIG utilization prior to second-line therapy. Age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95 % CI 1.02-1.07, P < 0.0001) and prior intracranial hemorrhage (aOR 12.7, 95 % CI 1.6-272.8, P = 0.03) were significant predictors of second-line TPO-RA. TPO-RA is associated with a trend towards longer median RFS (6.3 vs 3.8 years, P = 0.06) compared with rituximab, and similar rates of ITP-related hospitalizations, major bleeding, and thromboembolism. Age, time period, and Charlson comorbidity index, but not second-line ITP therapy, were significant predictors of OS.
Our study identified older age and intracranial hemorrhage as predictors of second-line TPO-RA prescription in a real-world practice. There were no significant differences in hospitalizations and outcomes between second-line rituximab and TPO-RA, although delayed initiation of TPO-RA was associated with higher blood product utilization."

Here, we present a case of a young male with biopsy-proven eosinophilic gastroenteritis with a concomitant established diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  Presently, EGIDs remain an underexplored clinical entity. While its pathophysiology is not fully understood at this time, TH2 mediated activation of B-cells and subsequent stimulation of eosinophils locally appears to be at play. This is in contrast to the TH1 predominant cytokine profile underlying ITP, which this patient also has. Treatment typically involves dietary modifications and glucocorticoids."
36223210,ADAMTS13 Biomarkers in Management of Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.,"Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare but potentially fatal blood disorder resulting from acquired deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves endothelium-derived ultralarge von Willebrand factor. Standard of care for iTTP including therapeutic plasma exchange, caplacizumab, and immunosuppressives, known as triple therapy, has led to a significant reduction in the disease-related mortality rate. The first International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis TTP guidelines stress the importance of having plasma ADAMTS13 activity testing in the algorithm for diagnosis and management of iTTP. However, the predictive role of assessing plasma ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitors or other ADAMTS13-related parameters in patients with acute iTTP and during remission has not been systematically evaluated.
To review and assess the predictive values of testing plasma ADAMTS13 activity, antigen, and inhibitors or anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G at various stages of disease in outcomes of iTTP.
Peer-reviewed publications and personal experience.
We conclude that assessing ADAMTS13 biomarkers is not only essential for establishing the initial diagnosis, but also crucial for risk stratification and the early detection of disease recurrence. This may guide therapeutic interventions during acute episodes and for long-term follow-up of iTTP patients."
36218255,[Guillain-Barre syndrome and thrombocytopenia after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with Moderna. A case report].,"The massive vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated to be one of the major measures for the reduction of the morbidity and mortality that this virus causes. However, during the last months the administration of the vaccine has been also associated with some rare, but life-threatening, adverse effects.
In this article we describe the case of a patient that developed a Guillain-Barre syndrome and an Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura nine days after the vaccination with the third dose for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Moderna). He had received previously two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Moreover, the patient was positive for auto-antibodies anti-SSA/Ro60 and auto-antibodies IgG anti-GM1 and IgG anti-GM3.
Even though it is not possible to stablish a clear relation of causality between the administration of the vaccine booster for SARS-CoV-2 and the diseases developed by the patient, the association of two concomitant autoimmune processes is remarkable. As well as the positivity for the auto-antibodies anti-SSA/Ro60, which have been described in the bibliography in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introducción. La vacunación masiva contra el virus SARS-CoV-2 constituye una de las principales estrategias en la reducción de la morbimortalidad que presenta dicho virus. No obstante, a lo largo de los últimos meses, su administración también se ha relacionado con diversos efectos adversos raros, pero potencialmente graves. Caso clínico. En el presente artículo describimos el caso de un paciente que desarrolló un síndrome de Guillain-Barré y una púrpura trombocitopénica idiopática nueve días después de la vacunación con la tercera dosis contra el virus SARS-CoV-2 (Moderna), con dos dosis previas de AstraZeneca. Adicionalmente, destaca la presencia de positividad para autoanticuerpos anti-SSA/Ro60 y para anticuerpos inmunoglobulina G anti-GM1 e inmunoglobulina G anti-GM3. Conclusión. Aunque no es posible establecer una relación de causalidad entre la administración del booster de la vacuna y el desarrollo de la enfermedad, es destacable la asociación de dos procesos autoinmunes concomitantes, junto con la positividad en los autoanticuerpos anti-SSA/Ro60, lo cual se ha descrito en la bibliografía en casos de infección del virus SARS-CoV-2."
36210565,Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia and patients with cancer.,"Vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic were quickly developed due to significant and combined efforts by the scientific community, government agencies, and private sector pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Following vaccine development, which took less than a year to accomplish, randomized placebo controlled clinical trials enrolled almost 100,000 people, demonstrating efficacy and no major safety signals. Vaccination programs were started, but shortly thereafter a small number of patients with a constellation of findings including thrombosis in unusual locations, thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer and often low fibrinogen led another intense and concentrated scientific effort to understand this syndrome. It was recognized that this occurred within a short time following administration of adenoviral vector SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Critical to the rapid understanding of this syndrome was prompt communication among clinicians and scientists and exchange of knowledge. Now known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (VITT), progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of the syndrome, with the development of diagnostic criteria, and most importantly therapeutic strategies needed to effectively treat this rare complication of adenoviral vector vaccination. This review will focus on the current understanding of the pathophysiology of VITT, the findings that affected patients present with, and the rational for therapies, including for patients with cancer, as prompt recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of this syndrome has resulted in a dramatic decrease in associated mortality."
36208267,[Factors Influencing the efficacy of Plasma Exchange in the Treatment of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura].,"To observe the efficacy of plasma exchange in the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and to analyze the factors influencing the efficacy of plasma exchange in the treatment of ITP.
The medical records of 39 ITP patients who were treated effectively by plasma exchange in Huai'an First People's Hospital from January 2013 to January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed, and they were set as the effective group. In addition, the medical records of 39 ITP patients who were treated ineffective by plasma exchange during the same period in our hospital were collected, and they were set as the ineffective group. The general data such as sex and age of patients and laboratory indicators on admission were collected and recorded. The possible influencing factors were included, and Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influencing factors of efficacy of plasma exchange in the treatment of ITP.
The serum levels of IL-6, IL-18 and B lymphocyte activating factor (BAFF) on admission in the ineffective group were significantly higher than those in the effective group, and the proportions of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and splenomegaly were significantly higher than those in the effective group (P<0.05). There was no statistical significantly difference in sex, age and other data between the two groups (P>0.05). After single factor analysis, multiple regression model was established, which showed that splenomegaly, HP infection and the over expression of serum IL-6, IL-18 and BAFF on admission might be the influencing factors of ineffective treatment of ITP by plasma exchange (OR>1, P<0.05).
The over expression of serum IL-6, IL-18, BAFF, splenomegaly and HP infection on admission may be the influencing factors resulting in the ineffective treatment of plasma exchange in ITP.

The European Medicines Agency labelled immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as a rare adverse reaction of unknown frequency after vector-, but not mRNA-vaccination. Here, we report on the long-term outcome of 6 patients who were diagnosed with de-novo, vaccine-associated ITP (VA-ITP), and on the outcome of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-vaccinations.
Patients were included after presenting to our emergency department. Therapy was applied according to ITP guidelines. Follow-up data were obtained from outpatient departments. Both mRNA- or vector-based vaccines were each used in 3 cases, respectively.
In all patients, the onset of symptoms occurred after the 1st dose of vaccine was applied. 5 patients required treatment, 3 of them 2nd line therapy. All patients showed a complete response eventually. After up to 359 days of follow-up, 2 patients were still under 2nd line therapy with thrombopoietin receptor agonists. 5 patients have been re-vaccinated with up to 3 consecutive doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, 4 of them showing stable platelet counts hereafter.
Thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination should trigger a diagnostic workup to exclude vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and, if confirmed, VA-ITP should be treated according to current ITP guidelines. Re-vaccination of patients seems feasible under close monitoring of blood counts and using a vaccine that differs from the one triggering the initial episode of VA-ITP."

Subsequent lines of therapy include an array of immunosuppressive and immune-modulating agents directed by drug availability and physician and patient preference.
The objective of the study was to describe the use of first and subsequent lines of treatment for adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Australia and to assess their effectiveness and tolerability.
A retrospective review of medical records was conducted of 322 patients treated for ITP at eight participating centers in Australia between 2013 and 2020. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and frequency distribution using pivot tables, and comparisons between centers were assessed using paired 
Mean age at diagnosis of ITP was 48.8 years (standard deviation [SD], 22.6) and 58.3% were women. Primary ITP was observed in 72% and secondary ITP in 28% of the patients; 95% of patients received first-line treatment with prednisolone (76%), dexamethasone (15%), or intravenous immunoglobulin (48%) alone or in combination. Individuals with secondary ITP were less steroid dependent (72% vs. 76%) and required less treatment with a second-line agent (47% vs. 58%) in the study sample. Over half (56%) of the cohort received treatment with one or more second-line agents. The mean number of second-line agents used for each patient was 1.9 (SD, 1.2). The most used second-line therapy was rituximab, followed by etrombopag and splenectomy. These also generated the highest rates of complete response (60.3%, 72.1%, and 71.8% respectively). The most unfavorable side effect profiles were seen in long-term corticosteroids and splenectomy.
A wide range of ""second-line"" agents were used across centers with variable response rates and side effect profiles. Findings suggest greater effectiveness of rituximab and TPO-A, supporting their use earlier in the treatment course of patients with ITP across Australia."
36185943,Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura After Ad6.COV2.S Vaccination.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by the deficiency of ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor cleaving protease, which results in thrombotic microangiopathy. It is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and microvascular thrombosis leading to organ damage. It has an extremely high mortality rate if left untreated, making early diagnosis and treatment of the utmost importance. We report a case of TTP that developed after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S COVID vaccine. We present a case of a 50-year-old African American female who presented with dyspnea one week after receiving the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Initial labs showed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and markers of intravascular hemolysis. The suspicion for thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndromes (TTS), vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), TTP, and Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was high based on the history and laboratory results. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities did not show any evidence of thrombosis. The absence of thrombosis in the presence of a high PLASMIC score increased the suspicion of TTP over the other differentials. Diagnosis of TTP was confirmed when the ADAMTS13 level was low with an elevated autoantibody inhibitor level. The patient underwent treatment with corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and rituximab with improvement in symptoms and platelet count. TTP and VITT are the possible differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and signs of hemolysis after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S.

We used STATA 16.0 and RevMan 5.3 for meta-analysis and GRADE pro. for evidence quality evaluation.
A total of 27 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and the results showed a significant difference (all p<0.05) in the effective rate, recurrence rate, the number of platelets, and the recovery time of platelets (≥ 100×109) between ITP patients in the control group (who received glucocorticoid therapy alone) and test group (who received glucocorticoid therapy combined with the Shengxuexiaoban Capsules). And that Shengxuexiaoban capsules combined with glucocorticoid therapy were safe. The funnel plot and Egger's test results indicated no obvious publication bias. The GRADE evidence rating showed an intermediate quality of evidence rating for recurrence rate and overall effectiveness.
Glucocorticoid therapy combined with the Shengxuexiaoban Capsules showed more effectiveness in the treatment of ITP. It can improve the effective rate, reduce the recurrence rate, increase the number of platelets and shorten the recovery time of platelets, and has a good safety profile."

Of 666 patients with an iTTP diagnosis between October 2015 and December 2019, 302 (45%) had one or more iTTP episodes. The pooled annual incidence of documented iTTP during this period was 3.43/million, and the annual incidence of one or more iTTP episodes was 1.81/million. Patients with one or more iTTP episodes received a median of six therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) sessions per episode; 86% received corticosteroids, and 59% received rituximab. Exacerbations occurred in 17% (52/302) and relapse in 11% (34/302); 34% (103/302) had one or more thromboembolic events. Mortality rates during the study period were 25% (167/666) among all patients with iTTP diagnosis, and 14% (41/302) among patients with one or more iTTP episodes. In the assessment of disease burden (January 2007 to September 2019), patients in the iTTP cohort (

Most commonly, these are autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and immune thrombocytopenia purpura. It is mostly associated with specific autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoproliferative disorders. We present a case report of Evans syndrome in a young man with primary sclerosing cholangitis and Crohn's disease, neither of which are classically associated with the condition.

36156812,Romiplostim use in pregnant women with immune thrombocytopenia.,"Treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in pregnancy is hampered by the lack of fetal safety evidence of maternally-administered medications. The Pregnancy Surveillance Program (PSP) collected patient information from 2017-2020 for pregnancy, birth outcomes, and adverse events (AEs) for 186 women exposed to romiplostim from 20 days before pregnancy to the end of pregnancy. Timing of exposure was available in 128 women. Seventy-one mothers (38%) had prepregnancy exposure to romiplostim; intrapartum exposure was known for the first (for many mothers when they discovered their pregnancy), second, and third trimesters for 74 (40%), 22 (12%), and 44 (24%) mothers, respectively, with 15 mothers exposed during >1 trimester. Among the 86 mothers with known pregnancy outcomes, 46 (53%) had at least one pregnancy-related serious AE (SAE); approximately 2/3 of SAEs were due to underlying ITP. Of 92 mothers with known birth outcomes, 60 (65%) had a normal pregnancy and 16 (17%) had complications, with both categories including term and preterm births; there were 12 (14%) spontaneous miscarriages/stillbirths, 3 (3%) ectopic pregnancies, and 1 (1%) molar pregnancy. Most abnormal births resulted from abnormal pregnancies. There were five neonatal/postnatal AEs of note: inguinal hernia, cytomegalovirus infection, trisomy 8 (third trimester single-dose romiplostim exposure), single umbilical artery without known anomalies, and development of autism at age 2 years. Seven of 12 infants with neonatal thrombocytopenia had resolution of thrombocytopenia before discharge; all 12 were discharged. Review of pregnancies in women exposed to romiplostim did not reveal any specific safety concerns for mothers, fetuses, or infants."
36155279,Acute-type acquired hemophilia A after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine administration: A new disease entity?,"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder. Various autoimmune diseases, including AHA, have been reported to occur after the administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. However, the characteristics of these AHA cases remain unclear. We report a case in which AHA arose in a young patient after the administration of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but improved rapidly. The patient's factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor titer spontaneously decreased to less than half of that seen at diagnosis. One week after the initial immunosuppressive therapy, the FVIII inhibitor had disappeared. Our case suggests that AHA that arises in young patients after COVID-19 vaccination may resolve spontaneously, and the levels of FVIII inhibitors may decrease more rapidly in such cases than in idiopathic AHA. Unlike for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), no acute type of AHA has been recognized. This case suggests that just as there is an acute type of ITP that develops in children/after vaccination, there may be an acute type of AHA that arises in young patients that receive mRNA COVID-19 vaccines."
36151977,Clinical features and neurological outcomes in pediatric immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: A report from a large pediatric hematology center.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a potentially life-threatening disorder characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and severely reduced or absent ADAMTS13 (A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13) activity, with varying degrees of organ dysfunction. As TTP is rare in pediatrics, most of the medical and scientific literature has largely reported on adult patients. As a result, limited data exist regarding the clinical features, comorbidities, treatment response, and long-term outcomes in pediatric patients with immune-mediated TTP.
A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted of all children and adolescents presenting to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, between the years 2001 and 2021 with immune-mediated TTP (iTTP). Clinical features, treatments, and outcomes, including long-term neurocognitive function, were analyzed.
Eighteen individuals were identified, six of whom had a total of 10 relapses, amounting to 28 episodes overall. Thirty-eight percent of the patients experienced exacerbations but, ultimately, 85% achieved a clinical response and clinical remission. Only one in-hospital death occurred (mortality rate 5.5%). Seventy-three percent of analyzed patients demonstrated long-term neurocognitive abnormalities, including cognitive delay, learning difficulties, and severe depression.
Children and adolescents recovering from iTTP are at high risk for neurocognitive deficits from initial and possibly ongoing microvascular disease. Due to risk for long-term neurological deficits, we recommend neuropsychological testing in addition to monitoring of other organ functions in all children with TTP, as well as long-term surveillance of ADAMTS13 activity during remission to detect and promptly treat early relapse."
36149532,Recurrent pain attacks during romiplostim treatment in a patient with ITP carrying a heterozygous MEFV mutation.,"We report a case of recurrent pain attacks during romiplostim treatment in a woman with immune thrombocytopenia carrying a heterozygous MEFV mutation. Five months after starting treatment with romiplostim for immune thrombocytopenia, she was diagnosed with idiopathic pericarditis. She was switched to eltrombopag, but thrombocytopenia did not improve. Romiplostim was restarted 7 months later, although she then developed recurrent right hypochondrial pain. The pain typically occurred three days after the romiplostim injection and resolved two days later. She had never experienced such recurrent pain before starting romiplostim or after discontinuing it. Genetic analysis showed that she carried a heterozygous R202Q alteration in exon 2 of the MEFV gene. MEFV mutation is known to cause familial Mediterranean fever, which is characterized by symptoms such as recurrent fever, abdominal and chest pain, arthritis, and pericarditis. This case suggests that romiplostim has the potential to trigger recurrent pain/inflammation attacks in individuals with systemic inflammatory abnormalities."
36146522,A Systematic Review of Reported Cases of Immune Thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 Vaccination.,"With the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency use authorization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, reports of post-vaccine immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have gained attention. With this systematic review, we aim to analyze the clinical characteristics, therapeutic strategies, and outcomes of patients presenting with ITP after receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Medline, Embase, and Ebsco databases were systematically explored from inception until 1 June 2022. Case reports and case series investigating the association between the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and ITP were included. We found a total of 66 patients. The mean age of presentation was 63 years with a female preponderance (60.6%). Sixteen patients had pre-existing ITP. The mean time from vaccine administration to symptom onset was 8.4 days. More ITP events were triggered by mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 ("
36144669,Correlates with Vaccine Protective Capacity and COVID-19 Disease Symptoms Identified by Serum Proteomics in Vaccinated Individuals.,"In the last two years, the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a scientific and social challenge worldwide. Vaccines have been the most effective intervention for reducing virus transmission and disease severity. However, genetic virus variants are still circulating among vaccinated individuals with different disease symptomatology. Understanding the protective- or disease-associated mechanisms in vaccinated individuals is relevant to advances in vaccine development and implementation. To address this objective, serum-protein profiles were characterized by quantitative proteomics and data-analysis algorithms in four cohorts of uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected vaccinated individuals with asymptomatic, non-severe, and severe disease symptomatology. The results show that immunoglobulins were the most overrepresented proteins in infected cohorts when compared to PCR-negative individuals. The immunoglobulin profile varied between different infected cohorts and correlated with protective- or disease-associated capacity. Overrepresented immunoglobulins in PCR-positive individuals correlated with protective response against SARS-CoV-2, other viruses, and thrombosis in asymptomatic cases. In non-severe cases, correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and HBV together with risk of myasthenia gravis and allergy and autoantibodies were observed. Patients with severe symptoms presented risk for allergy, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and autoantibodies. The analysis of underrepresented immunoglobulins in PCR-positive compared to PCR-negative individuals identified vaccine-induced protective epitopes in various coronavirus proteins, including the spike receptor-binding domain RBD. Non-immunoglobulin proteins were associated with COVID-19 symptoms and biological processes. These results evidence host-associated differences in response to vaccination and the possibility of improving vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2."
36143988,"Molecular Pathogenesis of Endotheliopathy and Endotheliopathic Syndromes, Leading to Inflammation and Microthrombosis, and Various Hemostatic Clinical Phenotypes Based on ""Two-Activation Theory of the Endothelium"" and ""Two-Path Unifying Theory"" of Hemostasis.","Endotheliopathy, according to the ""two-activation theory of the endothelium"", can be triggered by the activated complement system in critical illnesses, such as sepsis and polytrauma, leading to two distinctly different molecular dysfunctions: (1) the activation of the inflammatory pathway due to the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and (2) the activation of the microthrombotic pathway due to the exocytosis of hemostatic factors, such as ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers and FVIII. The former promotes inflammation, including inflammatory organ syndrome (e.g., myocarditis and encephalitis) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (e.g., cytokine storm), and the latter provokes endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD), orchestrating thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome in arterial endotheliopathy, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)-like syndrome in venous endotheliopathy, as well as multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Because the endothelium is widely distributed in the entire vascular system, the phenotype manifestations of endotheliopathy are variable depending on the extent and location of the endothelial injury, the cause of the underlying pathology, as well as the genetic factor of the individual. To date, because the terms of many human diseases have been defined based on pathological changes in the organ and/or physiological dysfunction, endotheliopathy has not been denoted as a disease entity. In addition to inflammation, endotheliopathy is characterized by the increased activity of FVIII, overexpressed ULVWF/VWF antigen, and insufficient ADAMTS13 activity, which activates the ULVWF path of hemostasis, leading to consumptive thrombocytopenia and microthrombosis. Endothelial molecular pathogenesis produces the complex syndromes of inflammation, VMTD, and autoimmunity, provoking various endotheliopathic syndromes. The novel conceptual discovery of in vivo hemostasis has opened the door to the understanding of the pathogeneses of many endotheliopathy-associated human diseases. Reviewed are the hemostatic mechanisms, pathogenesis, and diagnostic criteria of endotheliopathy, and identified are some of the endotheliopathic syndromes that are encountered in clinical medicine."

36138517,Long-term follow-up of patients treated with caplacizumab and safety and efficacy of repeat caplacizumab use: Post-HERCULES study.,"Caplacizumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) in the phase 3 HERCULES trial. However, data on long-term outcomes following caplacizumab treatment are limited.
The post-HERCULES trial (NCT02878603) evaluated long-term outcomes of patients with iTTP treated with caplacizumab in HERCULES and safety and efficacy of repeated caplacizumab use.
Over 3 years of follow-up, patients could receive open-label caplacizumab with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in case of recurrence. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed during the overall study period (intention-to-observe [ITO] population) and during recurrences (recurrence population). TTP-related events (TTP-related death, recurrence, major thromboembolic events) were assessed in the efficacy ITO population (patients without recurrence during HERCULES or before post-HERCULES).
Among 104 enrolled patients, incidences of AEs and serious AEs were similar between patients who had received caplacizumab + TPE + IST during HERCULES (n = 75) and those treated with placebo + TPE + IST (placebo; n = 29). TTP-related events occurred in 8% of patients (4/49) randomized to caplacizumab during HERCULES versus 38% (11/29) randomized to placebo. Nineteen patients had ≥1 recurrence; 13 of these were treated with caplacizumab. The first recurrence episode was resolved or resolving for all patients treated with caplacizumab, including nine patients with repeat caplacizumab use. All second recurrences (6/6) were resolved. Safety profile of caplacizumab for treatment of recurrence was consistent with HERCULES; most bleeding events were nonserious. No major cases of organ dysfunction were observed.
Long-term follow-up supports the safety and efficacy of caplacizumab for iTTP and its repeated use for recurrences."
36135951,Tacrolimus therapy in primary Sjögren's syndrome with refractory immune thrombocytopenia: a retrospective study.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC) for the treatment of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) with refractory immune thrombocytopenia (RITP).
Twenty-three pSS patients with RITP treated with TAC from June 2018 to June 2021 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Platelet response, clinical and immunological parameters, toxicity and safety were compared and analysed at baseline and different points after TAC treatment.
At 4 weeks after treatment, 2 patients (8.7%) attained a complete response (CR, platelet count ≥100×109/L and no bleeding), 15 patients (65.2%) achieved a partial response (PR, platelet count ≥ 30×109/L but <100×109/L and no bleeding or a platelet count at least twice that before treatment), and the other 6 patients (26.1%) did not respond to TAC treatment. At 8 weeks after treatment, a CR was seen in 4 patients (17.4%), and the percentage of patients with a PR increased to 78.3% (18 patients). The percentage of patients with a CR increased to 47.8% (11 patients), and 9 patients (39.1%) achieved a PR without relapse at 12 weeks after treatment. At 24 weeks after treatment, 14 patients (60.9%) achieved a CR, and 8 patients (34.8%) achieved a PR. Compared to before treatment, the level of IgG was decreased significantly at 24 weeks after treatment, whereas there was no significant difference in the levels of IgM or IgA between baseline and 24 weeks after treatment. Additionally, the absolute CD3+ T cell count, European SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score, and levels of IL-2 and INF-γ were significantly decreased at 24 weeks after treatment.
TAC is effective and well tolerated by pSS patients with RITP, and the mechanism underlying the effect of TAC in these patients may be related to reduced Th1 cytokine expression."
36127219,COVID vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: Rare but relevant.,
36126009,Thrombocytopenia: Evaluation and Management.,"Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 103 per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 103 per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 103 per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 103 per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 103 per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 103 per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding."
36124377,ADAMTS13 Autoantibodies and Burden of Care in Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic purpura: New Evidence and Future Implications.,"The introduction Caplacizumab in the management of Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) has raised different questions, considering its cost-efficacy and the optimal immunosuppressive treatment (IST) to associate. A retrospective multicenter collection of 42 first iTTP cases was conducted to identify variables associated with a higher burden of care and necessity of an implemented IST with early Rituximab (RTX) rescue. A significant correlation resulted between ADAMTS13 inhibitors (ADAMTS13inh) at diagnosis with total plasma exchange (PEXtot) and PEX needed to achieve clinical response (PEXtoCR, r = 0.46; r = 0.48), along with age (r = - 0.31; r = -0.35), platelet count (r = -0.30; r = -0.30), LDH (r = 0.44; r = 0.41) and total bilirubin (r = 0.54; r = 0.35). ADAMTS13inh also correlated with number of days of hospitalization (DoH, r = 0.44). A significant difference was observed in terms of median ADAMTS13inh titer at diagnosis in patient treated with RTX rescue and those responding to only steroid treatment. Thus, ADAMTS13inh titer resulted a marker of iTTP burden of care, associated with higher number of PEXtot, PEXtoCR, DoH and higher probability of needing RTX rescue to achieve clinical response and could be a useful tool for management of new iTTP cases and an interesting variable to optimize iTTP cases stratification in future Caplacizumab cost-efficacy analysis."
36121734,Development and internal validation of a clinical prediction model for the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a diagnosis of exclusion that can resemble other thrombocytopenic disorders.
To develop a clinical prediction model (CPM) for the diagnosis of ITP to aid hematogists in investigating patients presenting with undifferentiated thrombocytopenia.
We designed a CPM for ITP diagnosis at the time of the initial hematology consultation using penalized logistic regression based on data from patients with thrombocytopenia enrolled in the McMaster ITP registry (n = 523) called the Predict-ITP Tool. The case definition for ITP was a platelet count less than 100 × 10
The final model included the following variables: (1) platelet count variability (based on three or more platelet count values), (2) lowest platelet count value, (3) maximum mean platelet volume, and (4) history of major bleeding (defined by the ITP bleeding scale). The optimism-corrected c-statistic was 0.83, the calibration slope was 0.88, and calibration-in-the-large for all performance measures was <0.001 with standard error <0.001, indicating good discrimination and excellent calibration.
The Predict-ITP Tool can estimate the likelihood of ITP for a given patient with thrombocytopenia at the time of the initial hematology consultation. The tool had high predictive accuracy for the diagnosis of ITP."
36121724,[Recent changes in paradigms in the management of adulthood chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura].,"The scenario of immune pathomechanism-based first- and second-line therapies of immune thrombocytopenia (i.e., immunosuppression, splenectomy) substantially changed approximately more than 20 years ago, giving place and important role for thrombopoietin analogs in steroid refractory cases, positioning splenectomy as third-line intervention. Although this approach became dominant and powerful, refractory cases urged the search for further medications. More recently, the traditional immunological approach received more attention again, and new targets were determined: (1) shortening selectively IgG life span and clearance, (2) modifying complement system in an effort to reduce antibody binding to platelet surface, (3) cell signaling pathway modification efforts to reduce antiplatelet phagocytic events, mainly spleen tyrosine kinase and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitory compounds. These new agents seem to be capable alone and probably in different combinations and sequence of increasing platelet count even in thrombopoietin analog refractory adult chronic thrombocytopenic purpura cases. These promising approaches probably will bring new treatment schedules in the adult chronic thrombocytopenic purpura field quite soon, and the scenario moves back to the refreshed immunological basis rewriting many elements of the therapeutic algorithm of thrombocytopenic purpura.
Több mint 20 éve következett be a második szemléletváltás a krónikus felnőttkori idiopathiás thrombocytopeniás purpura (immunthrombocytopenia) kezelésében, amikor felismerték az amúgy megakaryocytás, de a fokozott thrombocytapusztulást mégsem eléggé ellensúlyozó csontvelői thrombocytaképzés serkentésének fontosságát. A thrombopoetinanalógok beléptek a klinikai alkalmazásba, gyorsan átírták az algoritmust, a splenectomia mára a harmadik vonalba került. Ezen paradigmaváltást az egyik szerző 20 éve ebben a folyóiratban is ismertette. Időközben sok tapasztalat gyűlt össze a thrombopoetinanalógok alkalmazásával, nagy előnyeivel, de azzal is, hogy még ezek sem oldanak meg minden terápiás gondot. Ez az útkeresés visszakanyarodott az eredeti antitestindukált immunthrombocytopenia irányba, azaz az immunmoduláns közelítésmódra. Ebben 3 fő irányzat látszik olyan mértékben ígéretesnek, hogy a közeljövőben be fognak épülni a klinikai gyakorlatban a szteroid/TPO-analóg refrakter vagy más, nehezebb idiopathiás thrombocytopeniás purpura esetek ellátási rendjébe. Ezen irányok: (1) szelektív IgG-anyagcsere (clearance)-gyorsítók, (2) komplementmódosítás a thrombocytafelszíni immunglobulin-kötődés csökkentésére, (3) ezen immunfolyamat jelátviteli útjának megváltoztatása tirozin-kináz- (elsősorban lép-tirozin-kináz- és Bruton-tirozin-kináz-) gátlással. Ezen elemek egymagukban, együtt, illetve a jelen modalitásokhoz kapcsolódóan átrajzolhatják az idiopathiás thrombocytopeniás purpura kezelési algoritmusait a közeljövőben, amire ez a közlemény kívánja felhívni a figyelmet.

36098792,B cell-activating factor is involved in thrombocytopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"Liver cirrhosis (LC) involves B cells that produce anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibodies, found in primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The role of autoimmunity in the pathology of thrombocytopenia in LC was investigated using 25 LC patients with thrombocytopenia, 18 ITP patients, and 30 healthy controls. Anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells were quantified using enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Platelet-associated and plasma anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody, plasma B cell-activating factor (BAFF), and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. B cell subset fractions and regulatory T cells (Tregs) were quantified using flow cytometry.The number of anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells was significantly higher in LC patients than in ITP patients and healthy controls (both p < 0.001). Platelet-associated anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies were significantly higher in LC patients than in ITP patients and healthy controls (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). BAFF levels were significantly higher in LC patients than in ITP patients and healthy controls (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), and APRIL levels were significantly higher in LC patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). Anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells and platelet-associated anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies were positively correlated with BAFF levels in LC patients. LC patients had more naïve B cells and plasmablasts than healthy controls (p = 0.005, p = 0.03, respectively); plasmablasts were positively correlated with BAFF levels. LC patients had similar Tregs levels as ITP patients and healthy controls. Therefore, excessive BAFF production in LC patients with thrombocytopenia is likely associated with autoimmune B cell response, inducing anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody production."

Early morning fasting venous blood was collected from both groups, and the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocytes was measured and compared using a fully automated hematology analyzer to investigate the diagnostic value of absolute peripheral blood lymphocytes in primary immune thrombocytopenia. The CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD4+/CD8+, and CD16+CD56+ assay values in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, and the CD3+CD8+, CD19+, and ALC assay values were higher than those in the control group ("

However, it has been reported that COVID-19 related vaccines may induce or exacerbate autoimmune hematological disorders, for example, a decrease in platelet numbers characteristic of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). To investigate this, we retrospectively reported, for the first time, the clinical characteristics of 42 ITP patients after COVID-19 vaccination in southwest China. Of the 42 patients, 28 patients were historically diagnosed ITP, and their platelet counts (PC) decrease mainly occurred after the first-dose vaccinations.

We sought to examine the clinical characteristics of patients with primary ITP who later developed SLE and identified the risk factors for the development of SLE.
We retrospectively examined patients who were diagnosed with primary ITP at a tertiary hospital between August 2001 and November 2019. We compared the clinical characteristics according to the development of SLE. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with the development of SLE.
Of 130 patients with primary ITP, 10 (7.7%) were later diagnosed with SLE during follow-up (median, 30 months [IQR, 15.5-105]). The presence of skin bleeding, organ bleeding, lymphocytopenia, anemia, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (≥ 1:160) were more common among patients who later developed SLE than did those who did not develop SLE. Multivariate analysis showed that young age (< 40 years; odds ratio [OR], 6.307 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.114-34.908]; P = 0.035), organ bleeding (OR, 13.672 [95% CI, 2.437-76.689]; P = 0.003), and ANA positivity (1:160; OR, 6.638 [95% CI, 1.399-31.504]; P = 0.017) were significantly associated with the development of SLE.
Young age (< 40 years), organ bleeding, and ANA positivity (≥ 1:160) were risk factors for the development of SLE in patients with primary ITP. Close follow-up is needed to detect the development of SLE in patients with ITP and the abovementioned risk factors."
36066607,Efficacy and steroid-sparing effect of tacrolimus in patients with autoimmune cytopenia.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and steroid-sparing effect of tacrolimus in patients with autoimmune cytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and Evans syndrome (ES). Patients in the tacrolimus group were treated with tacrolimus in combination with steroids, and the control group received only steroids. Of the 318 patients finally enrolled, 87 (27.4%) were males, with a median age of 45 (14-90) years. The tacrolimus group comprised 144 patients, including 120 ITP, 19 AIHA, and 5 ES patients, and the control group comprised 174 patients, including 141 ITP, 25 AIHA, and 8 ES patients. The optimal ORR of the tacrolimus group was comparable to that of the control group, and the optimal CRR was higher (p < 0.05). Patients receiving tacrolimus had a decreased relapse rate and prolonged relapse-free survival (p < 0.05) compared with the controls for both the whole cohort and the ITP and AIHA subgroups. Compared with the control group, the tacrolimus group had a lower cumulative steroid dosage and earlier discontinuation of steroids (p < 0.05), which resulted in a decreased incidence of steroid-related adverse events (p < 0.05) although the total side effects were similar between the two groups. Similar drug expenses were observed between the tacrolimus and control groups at the 18-month follow-up. In conclusion, the early addition of tacrolimus had a similar ORR, better CRR, lower relapse rate, and prolonged relapse-free survival compared to steroids alone, with reduced steroid-related adverse events."
36064843,NETosis and thrombosis in vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare yet serious adverse effect of the adenoviral vector vaccines ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) against COVID-19. The mechanisms involved in clot formation and thrombocytopenia in VITT are yet to be fully determined. Here we show neutrophils undergoing NETosis and confirm expression markers of NETs in VITT patients. VITT antibodies directly stimulate neutrophils to release NETs and induce thrombus formation containing abundant platelets, neutrophils, fibrin, extracellular DNA and citrullinated histone H3 in a flow microfluidics system and in vivo. Inhibition of NETosis prevents VITT-induced thrombosis in mice but not thrombocytopenia. In contrast, in vivo blockage of FcγRIIa abrogates both thrombosis and thrombocytopenia suggesting these are distinct processes. Our findings indicate that anti-PF4 antibodies activate blood cells via FcγRIIa and are responsible for thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in VITT. Future development of NETosis and FcγRIIa inhibitors are needed to treat VITT and similar immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia conditions more effectively, leading to better patient outcomes."
36058998,Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomach induces neuroinflammation: the potential roles of bacterial outer membrane vesicles in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach chronically. Colonization of HP in the gastric mucosa not only causes gastrointestinal diseases, but also is associated with extra-gastric diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and neurological diseases. Among neurological diseases, epidemiological studies have shown that HP infection increases the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Since HP does not invade the central nervous system (CNS), it has been considered that systemic immunological changes induced by HP infection may play pathogenic roles in AD and PD. Here, we investigated the effects of HP infection on the CNS in vivo and in vitro. In the CNS, chronically HP-infected mice had microglial activation without HP colonization, although systemic immunological changes were not observed. This led us to explore the possibility that HP-derived outer membrane vesicles (HP-OMVs) could cause neuroinflammation. OMVs are small, spherical bilayer vesicles (20-500 nm) released into the extracellular space from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria; OMVs contain lipopolysaccharide, proteins, peptidoglycan, DNA, and RNA. OMVs have also been shown to activate both innate and acquired immune cells in vitro, and to disrupt the tight junctions of the gastric epithelium (""leaky gut"") as well as cross the blood-brain barrier in vivo. Thus, in theory, OMVs can activate immune responses in the remote organs, including the lymphoid organs and CNS, if only OMVs enter the systemic circulation. From the exosome fraction of sera from HP-infected mice, we detected HP-specific DNA, suggesting the presence of HP-OMVs. We also found that microglia incubated with HP-OMVs in vitro increased the cell proliferation, inflammatory cytokine production, and migration. On the other hand, HP-OMVs suppressed the cell proliferation of neuroblastoma in vitro. Lastly, we found that AD model mice infected with HP had amyloid plaques adjacent to activated microglia and astrocytes in vivo. Based on the literature review and our experimental data, we propose our working hypothesis that OMVs produced in chronic HP infection in the gut induce neuroinflammation in the CNS, explaining the higher prevalence of AD in HP-infected people."
36054980,The short-term predictive value of CD4,"Dexamethasone (DXM) or immunoglobulin (IVIg) are first-line therapies for primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with an effective rate of 80 %. Some patients with both severe bleeding symptoms and platelet counts of <30 × 10
A prospective study enrolling 42 newly diagnosed ITP patients and 30 normal control volunteers was performed. The profiles of major CD4
Greater concentrations of Th1 and Th17 cells and lower relative numbers of Treg cells were found in the ITP group. As for the treatment outcome on day 14, the profiles of Th2 and IL-2 were significantly greater in the NR group, while the expression of IL-17 was elevated in the CR group. As for the treatment outcome on day 30, higher levels of Th2 cells were observed in those patients who needed 2× pulses of HD DXM compared to those who needed only 1× pulse of HD DXM and IVIg, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that lower Treg cell may predict favorable values. Meanwhile, the higher IL-23 value may predict a poor early response.
Our results indicate that Th1, Th17, and Treg cells and IL-2 and IL-23 participate in the onset of ITP. Higher profiles of Th2, IL-2 and IL-23 may predict poor treatment outcomes. Higher levels of IL-17 and lower profile of Treg may predict sensitivity to HD DXM and IVIg combination therapy."
36054971,Risk factors and characteristics of ischemic stroke in patients with immune thrombocytopenia: A retrospective cohort study.,"Previous research has found that patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have an increased risk of thrombosis, such as venous thromboembolism (VT), ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the risk factors for stroke in patients with ITP have yet to be determined. This study aims to determine the risk factors and characteristics of ischemic stroke in patients with ITP.
This study included adults with incident primary ITP diagnosed in a tertiary medical center between 2010 and 2020. The t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the variables between IS and non-IS groups, and the multivariate logistic regression model was employed to evaluate correlations.
The study enrolled 1824 individuals, of whom 17 (0.93%) had IS, and 138 (1:8) were randomly chosen from 1807 non-IS patients. Age was found to be substantially associated with stroke in the multivariate analysis (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.026-1.116; p = 0.001). We found no correlation between platelet counts (PLT) (OR 1.013, 95% CI: 0.995-1.033; p = 0.164), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet larger cell ratio (P-LCR), prothrombin time (PT) (OR 1.455, 95% CI 0.979-2.164; p = 0.064), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, fibrinogen or antinuclear antibody (ANA) and stroke. Of 17 ITP-IS patients, 7 (53.8%) were cryptogenic, greater than the general IS population. Three (23.1%) of them had an embolic pattern.
For ITP patients, age was a significant predictor of stroke. ITP-IS patients had a more cryptogenic origin, with some showing an embolic pattern."
36054922,Immune thrombocytopenia and pregnancy: an exposed/nonexposed cohort study.,"The risk of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) worsening during pregnancy and neonatal ITP (NITP) have never been prospectively studied. We included 180 pregnant and 168 nonpregnant women with ITP in a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study. A total of 131 pregnant women with ITP were matched to 131 nonpregnant women with ITP by history of splenectomy, ITP status (no response, response, complete response), and duration. Groups were followed for 15 months. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of ITP worsening defined by a composite end point including bleeding events and/or severe thrombocytopenia (<30 × 109/L) and/or ITP treatment modification. We also studied the recurrence of ITP worsening and the incidence of NITP and risk factors. The first occurrence of ITP worsening did not differ between pregnant and nonpregnant women with ITP (53.4 per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval {CI}, 40.8-69.9] vs 37.1 [95% CI, 27.5-50.0]; hazard ratio {HR}, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.89-2.03], P = .16). Pregnant women with ITP were more likely to have recurrence of severe thrombocytopenia and treatment modification (HR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.41-5.23], P = .003; HR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.14-3.57], P = .017, respectively). However, recurrence of severe bleeding events was not different between groups (P = .4). Nineteen (14%) neonates showed NITP <50 × 109/L. By multivariable analysis, NITP was associated with a previous offspring with NITP and maternal platelet count <50 × 109/L within 3 months before delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 5.55 [95% CI, 1.72-17.89], P = .004 and 4.07 [95% CI, 1.41-11.73], P = .009). To conclude, women with ITP do not increase their risk of severe bleeding during pregnancy. NITP is associated with NITP history and the severity of maternal ITP during pregnancy. These results will be useful for counseling women with ITP."
36053773,Adding caplacizumab to standard of care in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Introduction Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an acquired, fatal microangiopathy if untreated. Randomized controlled trials (RCT's) demonstrated faster time-to-response with adding caplacizumab to standard of care (SOC). However, concerns about RCT selection bias and the high cost of caplacizumab warrant examination of all evidence, including real-world observational studies. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the literature for comparative studies evaluating SOC with or without caplacizumab for the treatment of iTTP. We assessed risk-of-bias using the Cochrane RoB-2 tool (RCT's) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (observational studies). The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, and the primary safety outcome was treatment-emergent bleeding. Secondary outcomes included exacerbation and relapse, refractory iTTP, and time-to-response. Results We included two high-quality RCT's and three observational studies at high-risk-of-bias comprising 632 participants. Compared with SOC, caplacizumab was associated with a non-significant reduction in the RR (0.21 [CI 0.05-1.74]) of death in RCT's and observational studies (RR 0.62 [CI 0.07, 4.41]). Compared with SOC, caplacizumab was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in RCT's (RR 1.37 [CI 1.06, 1.77]). In observational studies, the risk of bleeding was not significantly increased (RR 7.10 [CI 0.90, 56.14]). Addition of caplacizumab was also associated with a significant reduction in refractory iTTP and exacerbation, increased risk of relapse, and shortened response time. Conclusion Frontline addition of caplacizumab does not significantly reduce all-cause mortality compared with SOC alone, although it reduces refractory disease risk, shortens time-to-response, and improves exacerbation rates, at the expense of increased relapse and bleeding risk."
36051029,Unmet needs in the management of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the potential role of caplacizumab in the UK-A modified-Delphi study.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an ultra-rare, blood-clotting disorder. Management historically relies on plasma exchange and immunosuppression; however, a 10%-20% mortality rate is still observed. Caplacizumab binds to von Willebrand factor and directly inhibits platelet aggregation; addition of caplacizumab to historical treatment induced faster resolution of platelet count in clinical trials. In 2019, a modified-Delphi study was conducted with UK experts, to develop consensus statements on management of acute TTP and the potential role of caplacizumab. An unmet need was acknowledged, and areas requiring improvement included: time to diagnosis and treatment initiation; time to platelet normalisation (TTPN) during which patients remain at risk of persistent microvascular thrombosis and organ damage; and incidence of subsequent exacerbations and relapses. Caplacizumab addition to historical treatment within 24 h (after confirmatory ADAMTS13 [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13] assay) would significantly reduce TTPN, which directly influences acute outcomes, with manageable bleeding risk and reduced burden on healthcare systems. Expert panellists agree that poor outcomes in iTTP largely result from failure to rapidly control microvascular thrombosis. Use of caplacizumab during a confirmed iTTP episode could offer better control and may plausibly improve long-term outcomes. However, this consensus must be validated with further clinical trials and robust real-world evidence."

Dysregulation of BAFF is involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell related autoimmune diseases including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of BAFF expression in pediatric ITP patients. Eighty pediatric patients with ITP are subdivided in three groups. Group I included (32 patients) diagnosed with acute ITP less than 3 months, group II (48 patients) diagnosed with persistent ITP (from 3 to 12 months) and chronic ITP (more than 12 months) and group III 20 healthy controls. Complete blood picture, autoimmune profile, antiplatelet antibodies, coagulation profile, bone marrow examination, and RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression for BAF for all participants in this study. BAFF expression levels significantly increased in cases rather than in controls. BAFF Expression Value significantly increased in groups I & II (3.10 ± 1.99&3.29 ± 2.58) compared to controls (0.83 ± 0.45) as p < .001 for both. On the other hand, groups I & II were comparable in BAFF Expression Value (p = .470). BAFF expression increased in ITP patients, implying a function in the disease's pathogenesis."
36041291,Autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions after COVID-19 vaccination. New case reports and updated literature review.,"Autoimmunity linked to COVID-19 immunization has been recorded throughout the pandemic. Herein we present six new patients who experienced relapses of previous autoimmune disease (AD) or developed a new autoimmune or autoinflammatory condition following vaccination. In addition, we documented additional cases through a systematic review of the literature up to August 1st, 2022, in which 464 studies (928 cases) were included. The majority of patients (53.6%) were women, with a median age of 48 years (IQR: 34 to 66). The median period between immunization and the start of symptoms was eight days (IQR: 3 to 14). New-onset conditions were observed in 81.5% (n: 756) of the cases. The most common diseases associated with new-onset events following vaccination were immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. In contrast, immune thrombocytopenia, psoriasis, IgA nephropathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus were the most common illnesses associated with relapsing episodes (18.5%, n: 172). The first dosage was linked with new-onset events (69.8% vs. 59.3%, P = 0.0100), whereas the second dose was related to relapsing disease (29.5% vs. 59.3%, P = 0.0159). New-onset conditions and relapsing diseases were more common in women (51.5% and 62.9%, respectively; P = 0.0081). The groups were evenly balanced in age. No deaths were recorded after the disease relapsed, while 4.7% of patients with new-onset conditions died (P = 0.0013). In conclusion, there may be an association between COVID-19 vaccination and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Some ADs seem to be more common than others. Vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 may induce autoimmunity through similar mechanisms. Large, well-controlled studies are warranted to validate this relationship and assess additional variables such as genetic and other environmental factors."
36037773,Investigation of the mechanism of action of Shengxuexiaoban Capsules against primary immune thrombocytopenia using network pharmacology and experimental validation.,"Shengxuexiaoban Capsules (SC) is a classical prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and has been clinically adopted in the treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in China. However, the underlying mechanisms of the actions of SC on ITP remain clear.
A network pharmacology approach was adopted to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of SC in treating ITP, and the effects of SC on the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of megakaryocyte (MK) and on the ITP animal model were investigated.
Network pharmacology analysis found 128 active compounds and 268 targets of these compounds in SC, as well as 221 ITP-related targets. The topological analysis found a central network containing 82 genes, which were significantly associated with the regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, apoptosis processes, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the ERK1 and ERK2 cascades. It showed that SC increased the proliferation and differentiation of MK, but had no significant impact on MK apoptosis in vivo. The addition of SC increased the gene expression of several potential targets, including STAT3, KDR, CASP3, and TGFB1. In addition, SC administration elevated the protein expression of p-AKT and inhibit the protein expression of p-ERK, but has no impact on the protein expression of p-P38. Moreover, SC could improve haemogram parameters, coagulation indicators, and the proliferation and differentiation of MK in the ITP animal model.
The present study systematically elucidated the underlying mechanisms of SC against ITP and provided an efficient strategy to discover the pharmacological mechanism of TCM. It may strengthen the understanding of SC and facilitate more application of this formula in the treatment of ITP."
36037415,Low-dose decitabine modulates myeloid-derived suppressor cell fitness via LKB1 in immune thrombocytopenia.,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are heterogeneous immature cells and natural inhibitors of adaptive immunity. Metabolic fitness of MDSCs is fundamental for its suppressive activity toward effector T cells. Our previous studies showed that the number and inhibitory function of MDSCs were impaired in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) compared with healthy controls. In this study, we analyzed the effects of decitabine on MDSCs from patients with ITP, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that low-dose decitabine promoted the generation of MDSCs and enhanced their aerobic metabolism and immunosuppressive functions. Lower expression of liver kinase 1 (LKB1) was found in MDSCs from patients with ITP, which was corrected by decitabine therapy. LKB1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfection effectively blocked the function of MDSCs and almost offset the enhanced effect of decitabine on impaired MDSCs. Subsequently, anti-CD61 immune-sensitized splenocytes were transferred into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice to induce ITP in murine models. Passive transfer of decitabine-modulated MDSCs significantly raised platelet counts compared with that of phosphate buffered saline-modulated MDSCs. However, when LKB1 shRNA-transfected MDSCs were transferred into SCID mice, the therapeutic effect of decitabine in alleviating thrombocytopenia was quenched. In conclusion, our study suggests that the impaired aerobic metabolism of MDSCs is involved in the pathogenesis of ITP, and the modulatory effect of decitabine on MDSC metabolism contributes to the improvement of its immunosuppressive function. This provides a possible mechanism for sustained remission elicited by low-dose decitabine in patients with ITP."
36035549,Primary Cerebral Venous Thrombosis in a Patient with Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune hematological disorder characterized by low platelet level due to its destruction through autoimmune antibodies. Cerebral venous thrombosis is a serious condition defined by a thrombosis in the cerebral venous sinuses that occurs mostly in the presence of a hypercoagulable state. Hemorrhage and thrombosis are processes with a paradoxical etiology; thus, the association between these two conditions seems to be extremely rare. 
The association between immune thrombocytopenic purpura (which is a major risk factor for bleeding) and cerebral venous thrombosis ( which is caused by a thromboembolic event )has carried a major challenge to the management plan. We believe that immune thrombocytopenic purpura and its treatment methods should be taken into consideration as risk factors for thromboembolic phenomenon."
36030503,COVID-19: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"In late February 2021, a prothrombotic syndrome was encountered for the first time in some of the recipients of ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca, University of Oxford, and Serum Institute of India). Since the hallmark of this syndrome is the development of thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis between 4 and 42 days after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, it was named vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Other names include ""vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia"" and ""thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome"" by the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VITT appears similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in that ""platelet activating"" autoantibodies are produced in both these conditions due to prior exposure of COVID-19 vaccine and heparin respectively, in turn causing thrombotic complications and consumptive thrombocytopenia. In this article, recent advances in the understanding of pathobiology, clinical features, investigative work-up, and management of VITT are reviewed."
36030136,Systemic lupus erythematosus-complicating immune thrombocytopenia: From pathogenesis to treatment.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common hematological manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The heterogeneity of its clinical characteristics and therapeutic responses reflects a complex pathogenesis. A better understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms and employing an optimal treatment regimen is therefore important to improve the response rate and prognosis, and avoid unwanted outcomes. Besides glucocorticoids, traditional immunosuppressants (i.e. cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil) and intravenous immunoglobulins, new therapies are emerging and promising for the treatment of intractable SLE-ITP, such as thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), platelet desialylation inhibitors(i.e. oseltamivir), B-cell targeting therapy(i.e. rituximab, belimumab), neonatal Fc receptor(FcRn) inhibitor, spleen tyrosine kinase(Syk) inhibitor and Bruton tyrosine kinase(BTK) inhibitor et al., although more rigorous randomized controlled trials are needed to substantiate their efficacy. In this review, we update our current knowledge on the pathogenesis and treatment of SLE-ITP."

36029490,Evaluation of CD4/CD8 ratio in children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).,"Intra Venous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a plasma-derived product used to treat many autoimmune diseases, including thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and infectious diseases. In this study, the effect of IVIG injection was evaluated on the number of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. The effect of IVIG was also considered on the percentage of CD4 and CD8 positive cells T cell lymphocytes and their absolute number in pediatric patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The study was a cross-sectional study performed on 32 patients with ITP. In these patients, a blood sample was taken before and one hour after the start of the IVG injection. For all samples, a complete blood cell, platelet count, and differential blood leukocyte count were performed by Sysmex kx-21. Then labeled anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 markers were used to evaluate the type of lymphocytes. SPSS software version 15 and a t-test with a significant level of p <0.05 were used for statistical analysis of the obtained results. Pearson correlation coefficient was also used to evaluate the relationship between patients' age and the total volume of injected IVIG results. Examination of blood cell counts showed a significant decrease in the mean of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes after intravenous immunoglobulin injection. However, these changes were not statistically significant for platelets. A comparison of the mean percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells shows a significant increase in the CD4 / CD8 cell ratio after injection. The absolute number of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes one hour after IVIG injection was significantly decreased, but their proportion increased after injection. Generally, IVIG reduces the absolute number of neutrophils, but this reduction is not associated with infection problems. This decrease is also seen in the number of lymphocytes. However, the change in the number and percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells depends on the sampling time following IVIG injection."
36028153,Don't neglect the rare adverse event with intravenous immunoglobulin: Hemolytic anemia.,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) associated hemolytic anemia is an under-recognized complication of IVIG therapy. The incidence of this adverse event is not clear. Patients at high risk for IVIG-associated hemolytic anemia include non-O blood group recipients and those undergoing high-dose administration for inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Here, two different cases of IVIG-associated hemolytic anemia are demonstrated. The first patient, a 66 year-old male with Guillain-Barré syndrome, had a severe attack for which erythrocyte replacement was required. Mild hemolysis was detected during IVIG administration in the second patient, a 57 year-old female with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Following IVIG termination, the hemolysis diminished gradually. Although it is rare and often manageable, clinicians should be aware of and monitor patients for hemolytic anemia following IVIG therapy."

36006172,Quantitative interpretation of PF4/heparin-EIA optical densities in predicting platelet-activating VITT antibodies.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a prothrombotic, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-mimicking, adverse reaction caused by platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies that occurs rarely after adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccination. Strength of PF4-dependent enzyme immunoassay (EIA) reactivity-judged by optical density (OD) measurements-strongly predicts platelet-activating properties of HIT antibodies in a functional test. Whether a similar relationship holds for VITT antibodies is unknown.
To evaluate probability for positive platelet activation testing for VITT antibodies based upon EIA OD reactivity; and to investigate simple approaches to minimize false-negative platelet activation testing for VITT.
All samples referred for VITT testing were systematically evaluated by semiquantitative in-house PF4/heparin-EIA (OD readings) and PF4-induced platelet activation (PIPA) testing within a cohort study. EIA-positive sera testing PIPA-negative were retested following 1/4 to 1/10 dilution. Logistic regression was performed to predict the probability of a positive PIPA per magnitude of EIA reactivity.
Greater EIA ODs in sera from patients with suspected VITT correlated strongly with greater likelihood of PIPA reactivity. Of 61 sera (with OD values >1.0) testing negative in the PIPA, a high proportion (27/61, 44.3%) became PIPA positive when tested at 1/4 to 1/10 dilution.
VITT serology resembles HIT in that greater EIA OD reactivity predicts higher probability of positive testing for platelet-activating antibodies. Unlike the situation with HIT antibodies, however, diluting putative VITT serum increases probability of a positive platelet activation assay, suggesting that optimal complex formation depends on the stoichiometric ratio of PF4 and anti-PF4 VITT antibodies."
36003388,Current therapeutic strategies and perspectives in refractory ITP: What have we learned recently?,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune bleeding disorder featured by increased platelet destruction and deficient megakaryocyte maturation. First-line treatments include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous anti-D immunoglobulin. Second-line treatments consist of rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and splenectomy. Although most patients benefit from these treatments, an individualized treatment approach is warranted due to the large heterogeneity among ITP patients. In addition, ITP patients may relapse and there remains a subset of patients who become refractory to treatments. The management of these refractory patients is still a challenge. This review aims to summarize emerging therapeutic approaches for refractory ITP in several categories according to their different targets, including macrophages, platelets/megakaryocytes, T cells, B cells, and endothelial cells. Moreover, current management strategies and combination regimens of refractory ITP are also discussed."
35998675,Off-the-shelf cryopreserved platelets for the detection of HIT and VITT antibodies.,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is suspected much more often than it is confirmed. Technically simple platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are sensitive but nonspecific. In contrast, accurate functional tests such as the serotonin release assay, heparin-induced platelet activation assay, and PF4-dependent P-selectin expression assay require fresh platelets and have complex assay end points, limiting their availability to specialized reference laboratories. To enable broad deployment of functional testing, we sought to extend platelet viability significantly by optimizing storage conditions and developed a simple functional assay end point by measuring the release of a platelet α-granule protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), in an ELISA format. Platelet cryopreservation conditions were optimized by freezing platelets at controlled cooling rates that preserve activatability. Several-month-old cryopreserved platelets were treated with PF4 or heparin and were evaluated for their ability to be activated by HIT and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) antibodies in the TSP1 release assay (TRA). HIT and spontaneous HIT patient samples induced significantly higher TSP1 release using both PF4-treated (PF4-TRA) and heparin-treated cryopreserved platelets relative to samples from patients suspected of HIT who lacked platelet-activating antibodies. This latter group included several patients that tested strongly positive in PF4-polyanion ELISA but were not platelet-activating. Four VITT patient samples tested in the TRA activated PF4-treated, but not heparin-treated, cryopreserved platelets, consistent with recent data suggesting the requirement for PF4-treated platelets for VITT antibody detection. These findings have the potential to transform the testing paradigm in HIT and VITT, making decentralized, technically simple functional testing available for rapid and accurate in-hospital diagnosis."
35989829,"A Rare Case of Severe Manifestation of COVID-19 Infection Presenting as Immune-Related Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura With Multiorgan Involvement Treated With Plasmapheresis, Steroids, Rituximab, and Caplacizumab.","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) caused by decreased activity of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). Platelet-rich thrombi in small vessels lead to fragmentation of RBCs causing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Therapeutic plasma exchange is life-saving and is the mainstay of the treatment of TTP. Higher dose IV steroids along with rituximab are used as an adjunct to plasma exchange. Our case report describes a 26-year-old healthy male who presented with new onset seizures and encephalopathy. Blood work demonstrated anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and elevated creatinine, and peripheral blood smear showed marked schistocytosis indicating MAHA. Plasma exchange and high-dose steroids were started on a presumptive diagnosis of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity was undetectable and ADAMTS13 inhibitor levels were elevated. Rituximab and caplacizumab were then added. Symptoms of encephalopathy improved by day five and platelet counts started improving by day nine. After several days of plasma exchange, he showed a ""clinical response"" with several weeks of active treatment. The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and the severity of TTP with multiorgan failure is not well understood yet. Although we describe a successful multimodal approach to the management of TTP, which we believe is secondary to COVID-19 infection, further research is warranted to analyze and understand the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 infection causes TTP. It would help in establishing standardized therapy in the future."

Recent studies on the gut microbiota have found that it plays an important role in human immune diseases. In recent years, the methods of sequencing gut microbiota has teen improved, thus dysregulation of the gut microbiota is found in many immune diseases, and the most widely studied mechanism is the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which is a metabolite of gut microbiota. The role of short-chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier, IgA immunity, dendritic cells and regulatory T cells has become increasingly clear. The mechanisms of short-chain fatty acids in regulating immunity and its role in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia were covered in this review, so as to provide a new idea for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia in the future.

This nationally representative study evaluates TPE utilization in hospitalized adults with a primary admission diagnosis of ITP. Hospitalizations with ITP as the primary admitting diagnosis were analyzed from the 2010 to 2014 National Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer inpatient database in the United States. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine clinical outcomes in ITP patients undergoing TPE. Sampling weights were applied to generate nationally representative estimates. From 2010 to 2014, there were a total of 56,149 admissions with a primary admitting diagnosis of ITP, of which 0.66% admissions (n = 372) also coded TPE. Most subjects undergoing TPE were the highest disease severity class: major (34.6%) and extreme severity (31.0%), by all-patients refined diagnoses-related groups severity of illness subclass. After multivariable analysis, underlying severity of illness remained the most significant predictor of TPE (P < .001). ITP admissions with TPE had a high rate of comorbidities (50%) and significantly longer mean length of hospital stay than those without (P < .001). TPE was reported in ~0.6% of hospitalizations with ITP as the primary diagnosis in this nationally representative sample from 2010 to 2014. TPE was performed in patients with the highest severity of underlying illness, and higher rates of comorbidities."
35979405,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Presenting With Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura at Onset: A Case Report.,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a syndrome associated with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and various organ disorders. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disease that develops when a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type l motif 13 (ADAMTS13) activity decreases to < 10% of that in normal plasma, causing platelet thrombosis in microvessels throughout the body. Currently, ADAMTS13-deficient TMA is diagnosed as TTP. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related TMA includes both acquired TTP, in which ADAMTS13 activity is significantly reduced, and secondary TMA, in which ADAMTS13 activity is not reduced. Both diseases have different prognoses.
An 11-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital on suspicion of TMA with thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Because the patient had hypocomplementemia, SLE-related TMA or complement-related TMA was considered. Therefore, we initiated plasma exchange (PE) for the patient. Subsequently, she fulfilled the pediatric SLE diagnostic criteria, and ADAMTS13 activity was shown to be decreased and the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody titer increased. She was thus diagnosed with acquired TTP caused by SLE. Treatment response was good as a platelet count and ADAMTS13 activity improved with three times of PE, followed by methylprednisolone pulse therapy and administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal pathology showed thrombus formation in glomerular arterioles and lupus nephritis categorized as Class III (A) of the International Society of Nephrology and the Renal Pathology Society classification. Because the patient was thought to be in the high-risk group of SLE, three courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy were administered as an additional induction therapy. No recurrence of TTP was observed.
In SLE-related TMA, measurement of ADAMTS13 activity and the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody titer are necessary for diagnosis, and for predicting prognosis and recurrence of the disease; however, in the acute phase of immune-mediated TMA, it is important to initiate proper treatments even before knowing the results to improve prognosis."
35975534,MicroRNA-21-5p Regulates CD3+T Lymphocytes Through VCL and LTF in Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune hemorrhagic disease with distinct clinical manifestations such as extensive skin petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and even visceral hemorrhage. In this study, CD3+T lymphocytes from ITP patients were screened for differentially expressed genes. The expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients were investigated. The downstream target genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were also searched for the correlation between differentially expressed genes of ITP.
Differential gene screening was performed using the GSE43177 data set in the GEO database, and the expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in T lymphocytes of ITP patients was verified by qPCR. The interaction network of core downstream target genes and ITP differentially expressed genes of miR-21 and miR-155 were constructed with the STRING database, and the associated factors were verified by qPCR.
In ITP patients, the expression of CD8+T lymphocytes increased, the expression of CD4+T lymphocytes decreased, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+T cells decreased. Fourteen genes were differentially expressed in CD3+T lymphocytes, all of which were upregulated, and the expression of S100A8 was increased in ITP patients. The expression of miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p increased in CD3+T lymphocytes of initial ITP patients. The core down-stream target gene VCL of miR-21 was associated with the differentially expressed genes such as LTF, LCN2, and DEFA4 in the interaction network. VCL expression was decreased and LTF expression was increased in ITP patients.
S100A8 plays an important role in the regulation of CD3+T lymphocytes in ITP patients. MiR-21-5p regulates the differentially expressed gene LTF by inhibiting the core downstream target gene VCL and participates in the immune mechanism of T lymphocytes in ITP patients. MiR-155-5p is also involved in the immunoregulatory mechanism of T lymphocytes in ITP patients."

We used a national prospective cohort with 2.0 million(m) adults vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx or 1.6 m with BNT162b2. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 14-20 days post-ChAdOx1 second dose was 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-5.08. The incidence of ITP post-second dose ChAdOx1 was 0.59 (0.37-0.89) per 100,000 doses. No evidence of an increased risk of CVST was found for the 0-27 day risk period (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.16 to 4.26). However, few (≤5) events arose within this risk period. It is perhaps noteworthy that these events all clustered in the 7-13 day period (IRR 4.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 17.51). No other associations were found for second dose ChAdOx1, or any association for second dose BNT162b2 vaccination. Second dose ChAdOx1 vaccination was associated with increased borderline risks of ITP and CVST events. However, these events were rare thus providing reassurance about the safety of these vaccines. Further analyses including more cases are required to determine more precisely the risk profile for ITP and CVST after a second dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine."
35968197,Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis following the First Dose of the Elasomeran COVID-19 Vaccination.,"Our case highlights leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a potential side effect of the elasomeran COVID-19 vaccine. As the elasomeran vaccine becomes more widely available to the public, cutaneous reactions should be noted and looked for as potential side effects of the vaccine. Our patient had a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, making this a potential predisposing condition to the development of vasculitis following elasomeran administration. The case of vasculitis in our patient, although diffuse in distribution, was self-resolving. Our patient was counseled of the potential risk of worsening reaction to the second dose of the vaccine and instructed to proceed at their own risk. He elected to receive the second vaccination dose without any further reaction or side effects. Primary teaching points from this case include the potential of developing leukocytoclastic vasculitis following the elasomeran vaccination. Patients who develop LCV following the first dose should be counseled of the risks associated with receiving the second dose, including progression to systemic organ involvement."
35962219,Upfront rituximab therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in systemic lupus erythematosus: a case-based review.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of various autoantibodies and deposition of immune complexes on tissues. Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening hematological disorder that rarely develops in SLE, mainly caused by inhibitory or clearing autoantibody against ADAMTS13. Although B cells play critical roles in the pathogenesis of two diseases, the role of B-cell depletion therapy using rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, in the management of TTP associated with SLE remains unclear. We present a 27-year-old woman who manifested TTP and nephritis simultaneously at diagnosis of SLE. This patient successfully responded to high-dose glucocorticoids combined with plasma exchange, and early administration of RTX-induced sustained remission of TTP without relapse over 16 months. This literature review in light of our case demonstrates relationship between early intervention with RTX and better treatment response despite the degree of ADAMTS13 activity. Moreover, we discuss the clinical features in TTP associated with SLE, risk factors for the development of TTP in SLE, and possible outcomes based on RTX dose. It is important to consider upfront RTX as a promising treatment strategy for SLE-associated secondary TTP to improve short-term response and long-term prognosis."
35953336,Potential mechanisms of vaccine-induced thrombosis.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a rare syndrome characterized by high-titer anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies, thrombocytopenia and arterial and venous thrombosis in unusual sites, as cerebral venous sinuses and splanchnic veins. VITT has been described to occur almost exclusively after administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S adenovirus vector- based COVID-19 vaccines. Clinical and laboratory features of VITT resemble those of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It has been hypothesized that negatively charged polyadenylated hexone proteins of the AdV vectors could act as heparin to induce the conformational changes of PF4 molecule that lead to the formation of anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies. The anti-PF4 immune response in VITT is fostered by the presence of a proinflammatory milieu, elicited by some impurities found in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, as well as by soluble spike protein resulting from alternative splice events. Anti-PF4 antibodies bind PF4, forming immune complexes which activate platelets, monocytes and granulocytes, resulting in the VITT's immunothrombosis. The reason why only a tiny minority of patents receiving AdV-based COVID-19 vaccines develop VITT is still unknown. It has been hypothesized that individual intrinsic factors, either acquired (i.e., pre-priming of B cells to produce anti-PF4 antibodies by previous contacts with bacteria or viruses) or inherited (i.e., differences in platelet T-cell ubiquitin ligand-2 [TULA-2] expression) can predispose a few subjects to develop VITT. A better knowledge of the mechanistic basis of VITT is essential to improve the safety and the effectiveness of future vaccines and gene therapies using adenovirus vectors."
35950156,Severe Coronary Artery Vasospasm after Mitral Valve Replacement in a Diabetic Patient with Previous Stent Implantation: A Case Report.,"Postoperative coronary vasospasm is a well-known cause of angina that may lead to myocardial infarction if not treated promptly. We report a case of a 70-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation submitted to mitral valve replacement, and a history of diabetes mellitus type II, stroke, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura on steroid therapy, and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for severe obstruction of the circumflex coronary artery, 4 months prior to surgery. Immediately after intensive care unit admission, the patient developed pulseless electrical activity which required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for hemodynamic support. The coronary angiography showed diffuse occlusive coronary artery vasospasm, ameliorated after intra-coronary administration of nitroglycerin. The following postoperative evolution was marked by cardiogenic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Subsequent echocardiographic findings showed an increase in left ventricular function with an EF of 40%, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was weaned after seven days. However, after a few hours, the patient progressively deteriorated, with cardiac arrest and no response to resuscitation maneuvers. Hemodynamic instability following the surgical procedure in a patient with previous PCI associated with an autoimmune disease and diabetes mellitus should raise the suspicion of a coronary artery vasospasm."

Up to now, vaccination has been the main strategy to prevent transmission and reduce disease severity. However, with follow-up observations after massive vaccination, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) induced by COVID-19 vaccines has attracted the attention of investigators. The present study reported the case of a 78-year-old elderly female who presented with 'oral bleeding for 2 days and scattered bleeding spots on the extremities for 1 day' after vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cells), and blood routine analysis indicated a white blood cell count of 6.27x10"
35945607,Enhanced rare disease mapping for phenome-wide genetic association in the UK Biobank.,"Rare diseases collectively affect up to 10% of the population, but often lack effective treatment, and typically little is known about their pathophysiology. Major challenges include suboptimal phenotype mapping and limited statistical power. Population biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, recruit many individuals who can be affected by rare diseases; however, investigation into their utility for rare disease research remains limited. We hypothesized the UK Biobank can be used as a unique population assay for rare diseases in the general population.
We constructed a consensus mapping between ICD-10 codes and ORPHA codes for rare diseases, then identified individuals with each rare condition in the UK Biobank, and investigated their age at recruitment, sex bias, and comorbidity distributions. Using exome sequencing data from 167,246 individuals of European ancestry, we performed genetic association controlling for case/control imbalance (SAIGE) to identify potential rare pathogenic variants for each disease.
Using our mapping approach, we identified and characterized 420 rare diseases affecting 23,575 individuals in the UK Biobank. Significant genetic associations included JAK2 V617F for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (p = 1.24 × 10

The patients were followed up for six months after the diagnosis of ITP. The clinical data of patients were collected, and the risk factors of URI in ITP patients within six months after diagnosis were analyzed using univariable, followed by multivariable logistic regression. Among the 242 ITP patients in the training set, 52 cases (21.49%) had URI, including 24 cases of viral infection, 11 cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, and 17 cases of bacterial infection.

35932324,Maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnancy occurring after a diagnosis of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Pregnancy is a well-established trigger for a first episode or relapse of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). Other outcomes of subsequent pregnancy after a diagnosis of iTTP are less well described. We conducted this retrospective cohort study to evaluate maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnancy in women with prior iTTP from the Johns Hopkins Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cohort. Of 168 women in the cohort, 102 were of reproductive age at diagnosis. Fourteen pregnancies (in 9 women) that occurred after the initial iTTP episode were included in the analysis. iTTP relapse occurred in 9 (64%) pregnancies. Out of the 9 instances of relapse, 5 relapses occurred in 2 women. Seven pregnancies (50%) ended in fetal death or miscarriage in the setting of iTTP relapse and three were electively terminated due to fear of relapse. Four pregnancies (50% of the 8 that progressed beyond 20 weeks) were complicated by preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, which is over ten-fold higher than that of the general population. No maternal deaths occurred. Only 4 pregnancies resulted in live births, of which, 2 were pre-term. Pregnancy in women with prior iTTP is associated with a substantial risk of iTTP relapse and fetal loss. Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome is also more common than that in the general population. ADAMTS13 monitoring and preemptive therapy may improve pregnancy outcomes, which needs to be evaluated prospectively."
35930913,High-throughput DNA methylation analysis in ITP confirms NOTCH1 hypermethylation through the Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a prevalent autoimmune disease with a complex aetiology where DNA methylation changes are becoming triggers.
To investigate novel abnormally methylated genes in the pathogenesis of ITP, we performed a high-throughput methylation analysis on 21 ITP patients and 9 normal control samples. We analysed the extent of key methylated genes and their downstream cytokines through Luminex assay or qRT-PCR. Then, bone marrow mononuclear cells were extracted from ITP patients, and decitabine (demethylation drug) was added to the culture medium of cultured cells. qRT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect whether decitabine could effectively affect target genes and related cytokines.
Through the STRING and Metascape databases, hypermethylated NOTCH1 can be identified and can influence ITP by regulating many downstream cytokines through Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways. Compared with those in the normal control group, the expression levels of NOTCH1 and its downstream Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and GATA3) were significantly decreased and those of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12, and TNF-α) were significantly increased in the ITP group. Decitabine exerts its demethylation effect, so the expression of NOTCH1 and its related cytokines in the ITP group treated with 100 nM decitabine were significantly reversed.
Our results suggest that the pathogenesis of ITP may exert its influence on epigenetics through alteration of DNA methylation at regulatory regions of the target NOTCH1 gene in the Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways. At the same time, decitabine may achieve a therapeutic effect on ITP by demethylation."
35930694,Real-world effectiveness of caplacizumab vs the standard of care in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. Caplacizumab is approved for adults with an acute episode of iTTP in conjunction with plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppression. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the safety and efficacy of caplacizumab vs the standard of care and assess the effect of the concomitant use of rituximab. A retrospective study from the Spanish TTP Registry of patients treated with caplacizumab vs those who did not receive it was conducted. A total of 155 patients with iTTP (77 caplacizumab, 78 no caplacizumab) were included. Patients initially treated with caplacizumab had fewer exacerbations (4.5% vs 20.5%; P < .05) and less refractoriness (4.5% vs 14.1%; P < .05) than those who were not treated. Time to clinical response was shorter when caplacizumab was used as initial treatment vs caplacizumab used after refractoriness or exacerbation. The multivariate analysis showed that its use in the first 3 days after PEX was associated with a lower number of PEX (odds ratio, 7.5; CI, 2.3-12.7; P < .05) and days of hospitalization (odds ratio, 11.2; CI, 5.6-16.9; P < .001) compared with standard therapy. There was no difference in time to clinical remission in patients treated with caplacizumab compared with the use of rituximab. No severe adverse event was described in the caplacizumab group. In summary, caplacizumab reduced exacerbations and refractoriness compared with standard of care regimens. When administered within the first 3 days after PEX, it also provided a faster clinical response, reducing hospitalization time and the need for PEX."
23149846,StatPearls,"Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count of under 150 x 10^9/L, is the second most common hematological abnormality in pregnancy. The International working group (IWG) adopted a lower threshold of platelets, 100 x 10^9/L, to define immune thrombocytopenia, which is observed in less than 1% of all pregnancies. Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy occurs either due to obstetric conditions (like gestational thrombocytopenia, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia) or secondary to systemic disorders (like thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura, immune thrombocytopenia). For the present discussion, the approach to thrombocytopenia has its basis on the trimester in which the thrombocytopenia develops and the etiology of the thrombocytopenia. This division will help in understanding the workup and guiding management. Even though thrombocytopenia is a common abnormality in pregnancy, it seldom leads to life-threatening complications by itself. The management of thrombocytopenia focuses on the underlying cause. Platelet transfusion is usually not required to achieve a particular goal and is only for bleeding patients. Local hospital policies govern the goal of platelet counts and are quite variable between institutions. Nevertheless, a hematologist must be involved in the management of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, especially if the platelet count drops below 70 x 10^9/L, or if a coexistent bleeding disorder is either encountered or suspected."
30060276,StatPearls,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a low platelet count, purpura, and hemorrhagic episodes caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies. The diagnosis is typically made by excluding the known causes of thrombocytopenia. IgG autoantibodies sensitize the circulating platelets. It leads to the accelerated removal of these cells by antigen-presenting cells (macrophages) of the spleen and sometimes the liver or other components of the monocyte-macrophage system. The bone marrow compensates for platelet destruction by increasing platelet production. ITP most often occurs in healthy children and young adults within a few weeks following a viral infection. ITP is usually manageable with immunosuppressive therapy. An identical form of autoimmune thrombocytopenia can also be associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, SLE, infectious mononucleosis, and other bacterial and viral infections. Certain drugs can also cause immune thrombocytopenia indistinguishable from ITP. Most children have spontaneous remission within a few weeks or months, and splenectomy is rarely needed. However, young adults rarely have spontaneous remissions necessitating splenectomy within the first few months after diagnosis.  The International Working Group on ITP defines ITP according to the following clinical phases. These are as follows: 1.

ITP without a secondary cause or underlying disorder is known as primary ITP and is the focus of this article. Secondary ITP is defined as ITP with an underlying cause or disorder, which includes drug-induced or systemic illness-induced (e.g., SLE, HIV, CVID, etc.). Severe ITP (generally when platelet counts are below 20,000/microL) warrants medical treatment. Primary ITP is further categorized into three phases based on the timing and continuation of symptoms. Newly diagnosed ITP is defined as from the time of diagnosis to 3 months from diagnosis. Persistent ITP is the continuation of ITP from 3 to 12 months from initial diagnosis, and chronic ITP is the continuation of ITP after 12 months from initial diagnosis until resolution."

35922885,Should dexamethasone alone or in combination be the initial steroid for adult ITP: Still a relevant question.,"Corticosteroids are used in first-line treatment in newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia. The goal of treatment is primarily to decrease autoantibody-mediated platelet clearance. Ideally initial treatment would not just increase the platelet count but also provide a long-term sustained remission. While many clinicians use prednisone (PDN) as their first choice of corticosteroid, others prefer dexamethasone. The controversy is the subject of debates. Short courses of higher-dose corticosteroids were first reported by the Andersen study in 1994. The study posited high-dose dexamethasone as a 'cure' for all ITP patients. Later, studies addressed the number of dexamethasone cycles, indications to repeat cycles and timing between cycles, with varied long-term results. The results with dexamethasone were compared to PDN in some studies: the four-day cycles of dexamethasone work faster in increasing platelet counts and appear to reduce the occurrence of severe adverse events. Therefore, it is probably a better option for patients with low platelet counts and bleeding diathesis; however, curative superiority, the initial reason to administer it, compared to PDN is not well demonstrated. Across the studies, treatment with high-dose dexamethasone seems to be safer, with lower incidence of all adverse events compared to PDN, which might be a reflection of shorter treatment duration and possibly also lower cumulative steroid dose. Dexamethasone in combination with rituximab in first-line treatment produced higher response rates with better long-term results compared to high-dose dexamethasone alone and is a particularly good option in younger women."
35920621,Distinct impact of IgG subclass on autoantibody pathogenicity in different IgG4-mediated diseases.,"IgG4 is the least potent human IgG subclass for the FcγR-mediated antibody effector function. Paradoxically, IgG4 is also the dominant IgG subclass of pathogenic autoantibodies in IgG4-mediated diseases. Here, we show that the IgG subclass and Fc-FcγR interaction have a distinct impact on the pathogenic function of autoantibodies in different IgG4-mediated diseases in mouse models. While IgG4 and its weak Fc-FcγR interaction have an ameliorative role in the pathogenicity of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies isolated from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patients, they have an unexpected exacerbating effect on anti-Dsg1 autoantibody pathogenicity in pemphigus foliaceus (PF) models. Strikingly, a non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 antibody variant optimized for FcγR-mediated effector function can attenuate the skin lesions induced by pathogenic anti-Dsg1 antibodies by promoting the clearance of dead keratinocytes. These studies suggest that IgG effector function contributes to the clearance of autoantibody-Ag complexes, which is harmful in TTP, but beneficial in PF and may provide new therapeutic opportunity."
35920091,Association of CD40 gene polymorphisms and immune thrombocytopenic purpura in the adult Egyptian population.,"The pathophysiology underlying primary adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has not yet been identified. However, many mechanisms affect the immune system, causing defective tolerance to self-platelets and megakaryocytes. Cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) contributes to both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.
This case‒control study was conducted to detect rs4810485G>T and rs1883832C>T polymorphisms of CD40 in Egyptian patients with persistent/chronic ITP to clarify their possible association with chronic disease evolution. This study included 50 patients with persistent/chronic ITP and 50 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction‒restriction fragment length polymorphism technique.
Genotyping of rs1883832 and rs4810485 revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. However, combined gene polymorphism genotyping showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (
Our results indicate a strong association between the combined polymorphism of both genes and susceptibility to developing ITP among adult Egyptian patients. Targeting this pathway using novel therapeutic approaches is promising."
35920090,Endothelial nitric oxide synthase Glu298Asp gene polymorphism in the cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Nitric oxide (NO) can induce apoptosis in megakaryocytes. Stimulatory function of NO on platelet production may be important in the pathophysiology of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). NO is produced by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS). The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) isoform has been detected in platelets. Polymorphism of the eNOS gene, which supplies NO synthesis, changes the functions of this enzyme. In this study, the role of eNOS Glu298Asp gene polymorphism in etiopathogenesis, its course, and treatment of ITP was investigated.
Sixty-six patients [51 newly diagnosed ITP (ND-ITP), 15 chronic ITP (CH-ITP), and 60 healthy controls (HC)] were enrolled in this study.
In all patients, the frequency of the GT genotype was 48.5%. The frequency of the GG genotype was determined to be 40.9% and the TT genotype was 10.6%. The most common allele in all patients was the G allele. eNOS Glu298Asp gene polymorphism might be a risk factor in the etiopathogenesis of ITP. Patients with the GG genotype were thought to have a high intention for CH-ITP. Patients with the GG genotype responded effectively to medical treatment using IVIG therapy. The presence of the G allele was observed to have a positive effect on the medical treatment of patients with CH-ITP, whereas the T allele exhibited a negative effect.
In the present study, a significant correlation was found between ITP and eNOS Glu298Asp gene polymorphism. This correlation suggested that eNOS Glu298Asp gene polymorphism might be a risk factor in the ethiopathogenesis of ITP."

35917140,Re-evaluate the Prognostic Value of Absolute Lymphocyte Count in Pediatric Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"To re-evaluate the prognostic value of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from the perspective of age. A total of 242 ITP pediatric patients, including 141 newly diagnosed ITP (nITP), 89 chronic ITP (cITP), and 12 persistent ITP, were retrospectively reviewed for this study. These patients were divided into 3 groups according to age (group 1, ≤24 m; group 2, 24-72 m; and group 3, >72 m). The ALC detected at admission was significantly different between nITP and cITP patients without considering their age difference (5.22 vs. 3.55×10 9 /L, P <0.001). However, no significant difference was discovered after age stratification (≤24 m: 6.52 vs. 5.34×10 9 /L, P =0.161; 24-72 m: 3.78 vs. 3.63×10 9 /L, P =0.748; > 72 m: 2.53 vs. 2.40×10 9 /L, P =0.748). ROC analysis showed that the prognostic value of ALC in ITP children was limited (area under curve (AUC): ≤24 m, 24-72 m, and >72 m were 0.591, 0.570, and 0.542, respectively). Analysis of covariance showed there was no significant difference in ALC between nITP and cITP when considering age as a covariate ( P =0.131). Instead, the ROC showing that platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has prognostic value in pediatric ITP independent of age stratification (≤24 m: AUC, 0.688; 24-72 m: AUC, 0.741; >72 m: AUC, 0.680). In conclusion, there was no significant difference of ALC between nITP and cITP patients when stratified by different age groups, and PLR may be an optional prognostic indicator for ITP."
35916756,Paraneoplastic syndromes: A focus on pathophysiology and supportive care.,"This article aims to increase awareness of, outline pathophysiology for, and offer guidance on supportive care strategies for specific endocrine, neurological, and immunological syndromes associated with paraneoplastic syndromes (PNSs).
PNS refers to remote effects that cannot be attributed to the direct or invasive effects of a malignancy. These syndromes are considered clinically important because they may provide early recognition, diagnosis, and management of the malignancy in a timely manner. Many of their presenting symptoms such as ectopic Cushing's syndrome, hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM), syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), neurological dysfunctions, and paraneoplastic autoimmune thrombocytopenia overlap with those of nonneoplastic disorders, yet their pathogenesis and responses to treatments differ. Management of ectopic Cushing's syndrome due to a PNS consists of treatment of the underlying malignancy and its comorbidities. Drug therapies may include ketoconazole, mitotane, metyrapone, somatostatin analogs, and dopamine agonists. Hypercalcemia may be classified into cases with parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent causes or PTH-independent causes such as HCM, in which osteoclast inhibitors may be deployed. Treatments of PNS-mediated SIADH include treatment of the underlying malignancy and strategies to increase serum sodium levels. Amifampridine is now considered the first-line agent for paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, whereas steroids, intravenous immune globulin, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eg, romiplostim, eltrombopag, and avatrombopag), fostamatinib, and rituximab may find their niche in treatment of PNS-mediated autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
Supportive care for PNSs lends opportunities to pharmacists to add quality, value, and safety."
35902837,"Antibody waning after immunosuppressive chemotherapy and immunomodulators, re-immunization considerations in pediatric patients with malignancy and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.","Immunosuppressive chemotherapy increase the risk of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in children; nevertheless, chemotherapy may result in delay or miss updated immunization schedules. The predictable antibody waning after incomplete primary immunization series may be intensified at the end of chemotherapy. This study aimed to investigate post-chemotherapy vaccine immunity waning at the end of immunosuppressive therapy in children with malignancy and hematologic disorders.
Children with malignancies and hematologic disorders including chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) younger than 18 years old were enrolled from September 2015 to August 2019. Eligible patients who completed their treatment protocol for at least 6 months were recruited. The patient information, including sex, age at the date of diagnosis, number of chemotherapy sessions, underlying disease, and vaccination history, was taken by chart review using predefined questionnaires. The patient's blood samples were obtained, and serum IgG antibody titer checked against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
110 children receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy were recruited. Forty-four (40%) of the children tested were girls and 66 (60%) were boys. The mean age of patients was 5.5 years with a range of 2 to 13 years. Of 110 studied children, 27.3% were seronegative for all antibodies. On average, patients undergo 19 episodes of chemotherapy. The mean chemotherapy sessions were significantly greater in children who were seronegative for all tested antibodies (mean: 36.2, 95% CI 33.16 to 39.24, p-value < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed regarding the patient's sex and age between the seropositive and seronegative groups (p-value 0.513 and 0.060, respectively). Based on Poisson regression model analysis, the female gender was associated with 37% lower odds of seronegativity (incidence rate ratio (IIR): 0.63; [95% conf. interval: 0.39 to 1.01, p-value: 0.55]), while chemotherapy sessions 30 or more was associated with significant odds of seronegativity for all tested vaccines (IIR: 25.41; [95% conf. interval: 6.42 to 100.57, p-value < 0.001]).
Our results reemphasized planned catchup immunization in children undergoing immunosuppressive chemotherapy for malignancy, especially against tetanus, diphtheria, and hepatitis B at least 6 months after the end of chemotherapy sessions."
35902184,Relapse of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) possibly triggered by COVID-19 vaccination and/or concurrent COVID-19 infection.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disease that may be triggered by inflammation, including infection or vaccination. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several case reports were published on de novo or relapsed immune TTP (iTTP) in COVID-19-infected patients. Case reports of iTTP episodes following vaccination against COVID-19 are also emerging. We report a case of relapsed iTTP in a patient who received Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and developed concurrent severe COVID-19 infection. The patient's iTTP was successfully managed with caplacizumab, therapeutic plasma exchange and high-dose steroids. We summarise published cases of iTTP associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination."

The majority of people affected by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are below the age of 30, while ITP is usually seen with peaks of incidence in the elderly and children. The unique case of an otherwise healthy 22-year-old female will be discussed, with an initial presentation of ecchymosis, rash, and epistaxis, and was subsequently found to have severe thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of primary EBV infection due to EBV was eventually made, responsive to intravenous (IV) Methylprednisolone. It is important to consider primary EBV infection in the differential diagnosis of a patient who presents with acute thrombocytopenia."
35867940,Primary immune thrombocytopenia: a 'diagnosis of exclusion'?,"Current diagnosis of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is presumptive, centered on excluding other causes of thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of ITP is challenging because of the wide range of potential inherited and acquired causes of thrombocytopenia. The treatment of ITP is empiric with steroids, high-dose immunoglobulin, immunosuppressants and thrombopoietin agonists with potential side effects. We searched Medline and Cochrane databases, reviewed the study data and analyzed the individual diagnostic tests for their evidence-based role in the diagnosis of ITP. We then analyzed the strength of the scientific evidence for each diagnostic test in the diagnosis of ITP and identified gaps in the diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic challenges in ITP include: insufficient evidence for the individual test for diagnosis of ITP, no standardized protocol/guideline for diagnosis, hurdles in accessing the available resources and failure to correlate the clinical data while reviewing the blood smear. We did not identify a diagnostic test that clinicians can use to confirm the diagnosis of ITP. In the absence of a diagnostic test of proven value in ITP, the clinician is best served by a comprehensive history and physical examination, complete blood count and review of the peripheral blood smear in evaluating thrombocytopenia."
35866784,Metastatic rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma presenting with treatment-refractory immune thrombocytopenia: A case report and literature review.,"Colorectal neuroendocrine cancer (CRNEC) accounts for < 1% of all colorectal cancers. It presents in advanced stages and carries a risk of poor survival. CRNEC may be diagnosed incidentally on imaging or routine endoscopy. When symptomatic, it may mimic colorectal adenocarcinoma. Syncope and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) have not previously been reported as clinical presentations.
A 57-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection on treatment, seizure and stroke without residue presented for the evaluation of fall and syncope.
Physical examination revealed tachycardia, swelling, and ecchymosis of his proximal left lower extremity. Laboratory tests showed a new isolated thrombocytopenia of 26,000/mm3. Computed tomography for a trauma survey showed an incidental left posterior rectal wall mass. After hospital admission, his platelet count dropped to 14,000/mm3. A peripheral blood smear revealed low platelet count, no schistocytes or immature cells. ITP at a high risk for bleeding was diagnosed and treated with standard medical therapy but remained refractory. Bone marrow biopsy showed metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, likely from the rectum.
Patient received courses of high-dose dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin. He also receive eleven units of platelet transfusion. A course of rituximab was administered. The platelet count response was suboptimal or short lived with drop to a nadir of 4000/mm3. However, after initiation of Eltrombopag, the thrombocytopenia resolved. Patient was started on etoposide, carboplatin, Atezolizumab. His hospital stay was complicated by neutropenia and sepsis, which was successfully treated.
He was discharged to subacute rehab in stable condition. About 4 months later, he was readmitted for severe thrombocytopenia, septic shock, and acute respiratory failure. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient deteriorated and expired.
CRNEC is a rare aggressive disease with dismal outcome that lacks standardized treatment. Metastasis to the bone marrow is uncommon and concomitant ITP has not been reported. We report a rare case of rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic to bone marrow associated with refractory ITP and review the relevant literature."
35864918,Efficacy and safety of rituximab as second-line therapy in immune thrombocytopenic purpura based on ethnicity: A descriptive study among the Arabic population.,"Rituximab is used as second-line therapy in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who do not respond to first-line management. The response rate for Rituximab is variable in different populations ranging from 30% to 90%. The adverse effects of rituximab in patients with ITP range from infusion site reactions to the reactivation of hepatitis B virus and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and interpopulation variation.
We conducted a single-center, retrospective study in Qatar's National Center for Cancer Care & Research. The study included patients with chronic refractory ITP who received rituximab as second-line therapy. Descriptive and summary statistics were used to describe the sociodemographic parameters of the study cohort.
Of the 41 patients with chronic ITP, 26 were Arabs, 12 were Asians, and 3 were of other ethnicities. Rituximab was associated with an overall response rate of 80.4%. Arabic patients had the highest clinical response (84.6%) among the ethnicities with the lowest adverse effects (11.5%). Asians had a response rate of 66.6%, and adverse effects were seen in 16.7% of the patients.
In chronic refractory ITP, rituximab appears to have a better clinical response in the Arabic population with minimal toxicity than in other ethnicities."
35849155,Thrombopoietin receptor agonist discontinuation rates and reasons among patients with immune thrombocytopenia: a study of administrative claims linked with medical chart review.,"Administrative claims provide a rich data source for retrospective studies of real-world clinical practice, yet some important data may be inconsistent or unavailable. This study explored factors influencing discontinuation of thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) among patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), by adding medical chart abstraction for additional details. Adult (≥ 18 years) patients with continuous commercial or Medicare Advantage with Part D health insurance coverage were included. Inclusion criteria were ≥ 1 claim for eltrombopag or romiplostim and ≥ 2 diagnoses of ITP between December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2020. Providers were asked to provide access to medical charts for abstraction. The analyses included only patients who discontinued TPO-RA and described patient characteristics, treatment patterns, platelet values, and reasons for discontinuation. Among 207 ITP patients treated with a TPO-RA, 137 (66%) discontinued treatment during the observation period. The mean TPO-RA treatment duration was 185 days. Mean platelet count at the time of discontinuation was 197 × 10"
35846034,Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: Successful treatment with tirabrutinib plus conventional therapies.,"When immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is secondary to malignant diseases, chemotherapy is expected to improve the platelet count (PC) as well. Herein, we report a case of a 72-year-old man with ITP refractory to standard therapies. IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was determined as an underlying disease. After bendamustine and rituximab (BR) therapy was found inadequately effective, tirabrutinib, a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initiated, and the PC normalised subsequently. Surveillance of underlying diseases with which effective therapies are available may help manage refractory ITP, and IgM-MGUS is potentially a targetable underlying disease with this newly available drug."
35843508,Lymphocyte alterations in patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) and autoimmune manifestations.,"Autoimmunity is a common feature in CVID patients. To date the mechanisms leading to the development of such complications are not fully elucidated.
Data from 122 CVID patients subdivided in three groups based on the absence of autoimmunity (n-AI) or the presence of hematologic autoimmune phenomena (Cy-AI) or non-hematologic autoimmune phenomena (n-Cy-AI) were evaluated.
We identified a total of 128 autoimmune manifestations in 55/122 patients (45.1%). 30/122 (24.6%) patients presented hematologic autoimmune phenomena while 29/122 (23.8%) presented gastrointestinal autoimmune involvement. Immune thrombocytopenia was the most common manifestation (27/122; 22.1%), followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (18/122; 14.8%) and autoimmune enteropathy (17/122; 13.9%). Cy-AI patients displayed higher CD4

35842925,ADAMTS13 conformations and mechanism of inhibition in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"ADAMTS13, a plasma metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor, is crucial for normal hemostasis. Acquired autoantibody-mediated deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 results in a potentially fatal blood disorder, immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). Plasma ADAMTS13 protease appears to exist in multiple conformations. Under physiological conditions, plasma ADAMTS13 exists predominantly in its ""closed"" conformation (or latent form), which may be activated by lowering pH, ligand binding, and binding of an antibody against the distal domains of ADAMTS13. In patients with iTTP, polyclonal antibodies target at various domains of ADAMTS13. However, nearly all inhibitory antibodies bind the spacer domain, whereas antibodies that bind the distal C-terminal domains may activate ADAMTS13 through removing its allosteric inhibition. Additionally, the anti-C-terminal antibodies may alter the potency of inhibitory antibodies towards ADAMTS13 activity. This review summarizes some of the most recent knowledge about the ADAMTS13 conformation and its mechanism of inhibition by its autoantibodies."
35839018,Association between ATP binding cassette gene member 1 polymorphism and glucocorticoid response in children with immune thrombocytopenia.,"ATP binding Cassette gene member 1 (ABCB1) polymorphism has been incriminated in susceptibility to many malignant, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Recently, it was reported that ABCB1 polymorphisms might have a link to disease progression as well as response to therapy. We aimed to study the association between ABCB1 gene polymorphism and glucocorticoid response in children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). A case control study was conducted on 90 newly diagnosed children with ITP and 90 healthy controls over a period of 1 year. ABCB1 (C3435T) polymorphism was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) in patients and controls. There was no significant difference between patients and controls as regards to frequency of different ABCB1 genotypes (CC, CT, and TT genotypes were 44.4%, 36.7%, and 18.9% respectively in patients and 48.9%, 38.9%, and 12.2% respectively in controls, P value = 0.18). 80% of patients who received steroids alone or steroids in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin showed complete recovery. There was highly significant relationship between ABCB1 genotypes and response to steroids where 55 % of responders had CC (wild) genotype while 40 % of nonresponders had TT (mutant) genotype. We concluded that ABCB1 gene polymorphism may contribute to the response to steroids in Egyptian children with ITP where patients with homozygous CC genotype responded better to steroids than patients with homozygous TT genotype. These results may help us choose the appropriate initial treatment in these children."

35834725,Evaluation of paediatric immune thrombocytopenia patients with clinical and laboratory findings: emphasizing the role of monocytosis.,"We aimed to investigate the relationship between demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings including monocytosis and clinical course in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Data of 100 ITP patients were analysed. Complete blood count findings of the patients at certain time points were evaluated to classify the disease as acute, persistent and chronic. An effect of sex on chronicity was not observed ( P  = 0.166). Of the patients enrolled in the study, 38% ( n  = 38) had chronic course. The mean age of patients with the chronic course was 7 ± 4.1 years, which was significantly higher than the other groups ( P  = 0.007). Sixty-five percent ( n  = 13) of the patients presenting with mucosal bleeding and 27.4% ( n  = 20) of the patients presenting with skin bleeding became chronic ( P  = 0.008). MPV was found to be significantly high in chronic ITP patients ( P  = 0.049). Monocytosis was noted in 80% of the patients at diagnosis. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 84% of the patients with acute ITP; 33% of them developed chronic ITP. The age at diagnosis, presence of mucosal bleeding and increased MPV on admission were high-risk factors for the development of the chronic course. Monocytosis was detected in 80% of the patients on admission, and it may play a role in the pathogenesis of ITP."

35821588,Kidney Transplantation From Deceased Donors With Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis: An Updated Analysis of the UK Experience.,"The emergence and attendant mortality of vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) as a consequence of vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have resulted in some patients with VITT being considered as deceased organ donors. Outcomes after kidney transplantation in this context are poorly described. Because the disease seems to be mediated by antiplatelet factor 4 antibodies, there is a theoretical risk of transmission via passenger leukocytes within the allograft.
We analyzed the experience of kidney transplantation from donors with VITT in the United Kingdom between January and June 2021. We followed-up all recipients of kidney-only transplants from donors with VITT to detect major postoperative complications or features of disease transmission and assess graft survival and function.
There were 16 kidney donors and 30 single kidney transplant recipients in our study period. Of 11 preimplantation biopsies, 4 showed widespread glomerular microthrombi. After a median of 5 mo, patient and graft survival were 97% and 90%, respectively. The median 3-mo estimated glomerular filtration rate was 51 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Two recipients had detectable antiplatelet factor 4 antibodies but no evidence of clinical disease after transplantation. Major hemorrhagic complications occurred in 3 recipients, all of whom had independent risk factors for bleeding, resulting in the loss of 2 grafts. The involvement of VITT could not be completely excluded in one of these cases.
The UK experience to date shows that favorable outcomes are possible after kidney transplantation from donors with VITT but highlights the need for ongoing vigilance for donor-related complications in these patients."
35821156,"Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, local thrombaspiration, and lysis for management of fulminant portomesenteric thrombosis and atraumatic splenic rupture due to vector-vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia: a case report.","Recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been observed to be associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Though vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a rare complication after vaccination with recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines, it can lead to severe complications. In vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the vector vaccine induces heparin-independent production of platelet factor 4 autoantibodies, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation. Therefore, patients suffering from vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia particularly present with signs of arterial or venous thrombosis, often at atypical sites, but also signs of bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and severe thrombocytopenia. We describe herein a rare case of fulminant portomesenteric thrombosis and atraumatic splenic rupture due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. This case report presents the diagnosis and treatment of a healthy 29-year-old male Caucasian patient suffering from an extended portomesenteric thrombosis associated with atraumatic splenic rupture due to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the first dose of an adenoviral vector vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)]. Therapeutic management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia initially focused on systemic anticoagulation avoiding heparin and the application of steroids and intravenous immune globulins as per the recommendations of international societies of hematology and hemostaseology. Owing to the atraumatic splenic rupture and extended portomesenteric thrombosis, successful management of this case required splenectomy with additional placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to perform local thrombaspiration, plus repeated local lysis to reconstitute hepatopetal blood flow.
The complexity and wide spectrum of the clinical picture in patients suffering from vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia demand an early interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Severe cases of portomesenteric thrombosis in vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, refractory to conservative management, may require additional placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, thrombaspiration, thrombolysis, and surgical intervention for effective management."
35818226,The relationship between different interleukins and T helper cells count in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia is the most common autoimmune disorder involving blood types. In several studies, the role of T CD4+ cells in patients with immune thrombocytopenia has been associated with different results. Therefore, in this study, with the aim of applied research in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia, the relationship was investigated between the number of T CD4+ cells, serum levels of IL-11 and IL-17 cytokines, and platelet count. In this regard, 100 patients with immune thrombocytopenia and 100 healthy individuals were included in the study. The T CD4+ cell counts were examined by flow cytometry and in addition, serum levels of interleukins 11 and 17 were measured by ELISA. The results of this study showed that the number of T CD4+ cells and plasma level of IL-17 were not significantly different between the two groups, but plasma levels of IL-11 in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group (P = 0.286). Overall, in this study, the level of cytokine IL-11 was significantly increased in comparison with IL-17 and T CD4+ cells in patients with immune thrombocytopenia, so it is suggested that measurement of cytokine IL-11 level in these patients could be considered as a critical diagnostic marker and indicator in the stages of disease progression."
35815383,"Interleukin-37, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and transforming growth factor-β1: promising biomarkers in primary immune thrombocytopenia.","Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune hematologic disorder with heterogeneous bleeding manifestations. Many biomarkers such as interleukin-37 (IL-37), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFß1) have a role in immunity, inflammation, and megakaryopoiesis.
In the present study, immunoassay of interleukin-37 as well as the gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A and transforming growth factor-β1 were done in 60 primary ITP patients, 60 thrombocytopenia patients, and 60 healthy volunteers.
Increased IL-37 level and down regulation of VEGFA and TGFß1gene expression were detected in primary ITP patients when compared with other groups. A negative correlation was observed between IL-37 and platelet count. However, a positive correlation was observed between VEGFA and TGFß1 levels and platelet count.
Current results suggested that interleukin-37, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and transforming growth factor-β may be promising indicators in the diagnosis of ITP and detection of disease severity with inexpensive and cost-effectiveness compared to the benefits."
35815306,Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Following Natural COVID-19 Infection.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has been linked to the COVID-19 vaccine series as a rare adverse event but has recently emerged in the literature as a sequela of natural COVID-19 infection. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion where a diagnosis is made by having isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/μL) and no other identifiable etiology for the thrombocytopenia. We share the case of a young male without any history of hematological or immunological disorders presenting with severe, symptomatic thrombocytopenia following a natural COVID-19 infection. Patients should be made aware of the potential risk of adverse events with not only vaccination but also even mild cases of natural infection with COVID-19. An emphasis should be placed on the fact that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the potential risks of adverse events, even in those with a pre-existing diagnosis of ITP."
35812544,Furosemide-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A Report of a Rare Case.,"Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) refers to drug-dependent, antibody-mediated platelet destruction. Although several drugs have been implicated as the cause of DITP, the most commonly encountered are heparin, sulfonamides, quinine, vancomycin, and beta-lactam antibiotics. However, furosemide has been rarely reported as the cause of thrombocytopenia. We present a unique case of furosemide-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia in a 64-year-old female referred by her primary care provider for low platelets, rash, and bleeding. She was recently started on oral furosemide for diastolic heart failure two weeks before this presentation. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and was worked up for new-onset thrombocytopenia. Labs revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and low haptoglobin with normal serum creatinine. Peripheral smear showed schistocytes, low platelets, and ADAMTS13 level was 0.03. The patient was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and treated with steroids, rituximab, and plasmapheresis, which led to rapid recovery of the platelet count to normal. Based on this case report, clinicians should consider furosemide as one of the drugs potentially causing thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Early detection and prompt management can be lifesaving."
35808925,Role of IL-10 and IL-22 cytokines in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia and their clinical significance.,"Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that leads to accelerated platelet clearance. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical role of cytokines in ITP patients and to correlate them with disease stages.
A total of 110 ITP patients were enrolled, including 55 with active ITP, 55 with remission ITP, and 55 with healthy controls. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to examine IL-10 and IL-22 serum levels in all subjects. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of IL-10 and IL-22 in PBMC. The clinical significance of both cytokines was assessed using ROC analysis.
IL-10 serum levels in active ITP patients were significantly lower than in control and remission ITP subjects (p < 0.05). IL-22 serum levels were elevated in active ITP patients compared to the control and remission group (p < 0.05). mRNA expressions of IL-10 and IL-22 in active ITP patients were also having a significant difference from than control and remission ITP group (p < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that IL-10 and IL-22 can differentiate the ITP patients from controls. A positive correlation between serum IL-10 and PBMC IL-10 with statistical significance was observed. Similarly, the serum IL-22 and PBMC IL-22 were correlated positively with statistical significance.
IL-10 and IL-22 seem to predict the clinical course of ITP, as a significant imbalance of these cytokines was detected in active ITP patients."

Higher doses of IVIGs usually serve as an immunomodulatory factor, common in therapy of children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Considering the broad range of IgG applications, the incidence of side effects in the course of treatment is inevitable. Aseptic meningitis, an uncommon but significant adverse reaction of IVIG therapy, can prove a diagnostic obstacle. As of April 2022, forty-four cases of intravenous immunoglobulin-induced aseptic meningitis have been reported in the English-language literature. This review aims to provide a thorough overview of the diagnostic process, pathophysiology, possible preventative measures and adequate treatment of IVIG-induced aseptic meningitis."

Rare autoimmune hematologic toxicities have been reported but are less well-described in the literature. Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune condition that has been reported with ICIs but has been limited to case reports.
We performed a retrospective observational analysis of the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data. We searched for cases of TTP reported with exposure to ICIs from initial FDA approval for each agent to December 31, 2021. Disproportionality signal analysis was done by calculating the reporting odds ratio (ROR).
There were 35 reports of TTP with ICIs in the FAERS database, including atezolizumab (n = 7), durvalumab (n = 2), nivolumab (n = 18), and pembrolizumab (n = 8). The ROR was significant for atezolizumab (ROR 6.22, 95% CI 2.96-13.09), nivolumab (ROR 3.16, 95% CI 1.99-5.03), and pembrolizumab (ROR 2.56, 95% CI 1.28-5.12).
There is a significant reporting signal of TTP with several ICI agents. Clinicians should be aware of and monitor for signs of this potentially serious adverse event."

Black patients are overrepresented in iTTP cohorts in the United States, but racial disparities in iTTP outcome and response to therapy have not been studied. Using the United States Thrombotic Microangiopathies Consortium iTTP Registry, we evaluated the impact of race on mortality and relapse-free survival (RFS) in confirmed iTTP in the United States from 1995 to 2020. We separately examined the impact of rituximab therapy and presentation with newly diagnosed (de novo) or relapsed iTTP on RFS by race. A total of 645 participants with 1308 iTTP episodes were available for analysis. Acute iTTP mortality did not differ by race. When all episodes of iTTP were included, Black race was associated with shorter RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.16-2.21); the addition of rituximab to corticosteroids improved RFS in White (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.73) but not Black patients (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.71-1.31). In de novo iTTP, rituximab delayed relapse, but Black patients had shorter RFS than White patients, regardless of treatment. In relapsed iTTP, rituximab significantly improved RFS in White but not Black patients. Race affects overall relapse risk and response to rituximab in iTTP. Black patients may require closer monitoring, earlier retreatment, and alternative immunosuppression after rituximab treatment. How race, racism, and social determinants of health contribute to the disparity in relapse risk in iTTP deserves further study."
35796625,Identification and verification of differentially expressed key genes in peripheral blood-derived T cells between chronic immune thrombocytopenia patients and healthy controls.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), characterized by decreased platelet counts, is a complex immune-mediated disorder with unelucidated pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that T cell-mediated platelet destruction is one crucial process during the progression of ITP. Here, we attempted to identify core genes in peripheral blood-derived T-cells of chronic ITP through the analysis of microarray data (GSE43179) and clinical verification, with the aim to further understand the pathogenesis and progression of ITP. Compared with healthy controls, 97 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 63 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated were identified in ITP patients. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in innate immune response, inflammatory response, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Among the DEGs, top 15 hub genes ranked by degree score were identified via protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and were further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Among top 15 hub genes, the expression levels of 14 DEGs like "

Bone marrow tissues were collected from patients with ALL and children with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (control) hospitalized in our hospital during the same period. Then, the FUT7 expression in bone marrow tissues was detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Human ALL cell strain Jurkat was cultured, and after knockdown or overexpression of FUT7, cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and invasion were examined by MTT assay, flow cytometry, fibronectin adhesion assay and transwell, respectively; the protein expression level of integrin 
The FUT7 expression was up-regulated in bone marrow cells of ALL patients. After knockdown of FUT7, the proliferation, adhesion and migration ability of ALL cells were significantly reduced, and apoptosis was increased, while the overexpression of FUT7 obtained the opposite results. Moreover, the overexpression of FUT7 also promoted the protein expression of integrin 
FUT7 can promote the adhesion and invasion of ALL cells by activating the integrin/FAK/AKT pathway."
35794926,Severe Thrombocytopenic Purpura Associated with COVID-19 in a Pediatric Patient.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is known to cause a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms to severe progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome with or without other extrapulmonary impairment. Hematological changes such as lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and anemia as the disease progresses, are frequently found in COVID-19. Thrombocytopenia may be drug-induced or can occur secondary to sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation or bone marrow suppression. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is frequently observed in children aged 2-5 years and in 60% of cases may proceed an upper respiratory tract infection. The present paper aimed to raise awareness of ITP as a possible pediatric presentation of coronavirus disease.
We present the case of previously healthy, eight-year-old female patient, who developed an immune thrombocytopenia flare, also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in the context of COVID-19, with diffuse petechiae and ecchymosis on her body, face and oral mucosa, and a nadir platelet count of 0×10
Platelet count recovery was observed after seven days of combined treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids.
The growing body of literature regarding the clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 infection in children, has reported thrombocytopenia in relation to unfavorable disease progression or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Clinicians must be aware that ITP may appear both in mild and severe COVID-19, at any time during its course, and can be associated with a higher bleeding risk, thus its diagnostic may be critical."
35793401,An updated evaluation of avatrombopag for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia.,"Multiple agents are available for the management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), including thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), rituximab, and fostamatinib. Although TPO-RAs are often selected as treatments for chronic ITP, when choosing between the TPO-RAs, clinicians must balance safety profile, dosing restrictions, and method of administration incorporating patient preference.
We provide an overview of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists with a particular focus on avatrombopag, the newest agent in this class. In phase II and III clinical trials, avatrombopag was shown to offer durable improvement in platelet counts. We also include recent real-world evidence describing avatrombopag effectiveness in patients with poor response to prior treatments (including other TPO-RAs).
Compared with other TPO-RAs used to treat ITP, avatrombopag offers practical oral dosing with a single pill strength, does not require long-term dietary restrictions, and has no warning for hepatotoxicity. It is frequently effective after use of other TPO-RAs in ITP. The primary downside with avatrombopag use at present is the lack of longer-term safety data in ITP that presently exists for romiplostim and eltrombopag."

In this brief report we'd like to report about our experience in pediatric newly diagnosed thrombocytopenia and how we have seen the landscape of this disease change in the last 2 years. In particular, we believe that the use of personal protective equipment and lockdown measures have reduced the incidence of viral triggers that are supposed to be responsible for the vast majority of ITP cases.

35784357,Case Report: ITP Treatment After CAR-T Cell Therapy in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.,"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is an attractive strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM). T cells are engineered to attack malignant cells that express tumor-associated antigens and better efficacy could be achieved. However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and hematologic toxicity are still challenges for CAR-T cell therapy. Among them, hematologic toxicity including thrombocytopenia has a longer duration and lasting effect during and after the treatment for some patients. Here, we present 3 cases of hematologic toxicity manifested as refractory thrombocytopenia with platelet autoantibodies positive and plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) concentration elevated after bispecific CAR-T cell therapy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM patients who were successfully treated with standard therapy of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Without clear pathogenesis or guidance on therapy published, our cases provide a reference for the treatment of thrombocytopenia after CAR-T cell therapy and inspire exploration of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."
35781630,Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Fostamatinib and Its Active Moiety R406.,"Fostamatinib is the first approved spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor for chronic immune thrombocytopenia. This review summarizes the clinical development, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions, adverse events, and comprehensive analyses of fostamatinib. While integrating these findings, we discuss the fostering and improvement of fostamatinib for further clinical applications. Fostamatinib is designed as a prodrug and cleavage of its active moiety R406 in the intestine. As R406 is the major product in the blood, this review mainly discusses the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of R406. It is metabolized by cytochrome 3A4 and UGT1A9 in the liver and is dominantly excreted in feces after anaerobic modification by the gut microbiota. As fostamatinib and R406 strongly inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein, the interaction with those substrates, particularly statins, should be carefully monitored. In patients with immune thrombocytopenia, fostamatinib administration started at 100 mg twice daily, and most patients increased to 150 mg twice daily in the clinical trial. Although responders showed a higher R406 concentration than non-responders, the correlation between R406 exposure and achievement of the platelet count as a pharmacodynamic marker was uncertain in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. Additionally, R406 concentration was almost halved in patients with a heavy body weight; hence, the exposure-efficacy study for suitable dosing should be continued with post-marketing data. In contrast, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis for exposure safety revealed that R406 exposure significantly correlated with the incidence of hypertension. Even though the influence of elevated exposure on other toxicities, including diarrhea and neutropenia, is still unclear, careful management is required with dose escalation to avoid toxicity-related discontinuation."

The 2 most common causes include neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, which leads to significant thrombocytopenia and risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia, which is generally less severe. No specific guidelines for prenatal management exist for either disease; however, intravenous immune globulin treatments and systemic steroids for women with at-risk pregnancies can be useful in both diseases. In this review, we discuss the current literature and management strategies for both pregnant women and newborns with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia."

This, added to other factors, is possibly associated with an increased risk of the appearance and concurrence of autoimmune diseases. The simultaneous occurrence of GBS and ITP has been rarely reported in the literature, and GBS is rarely associated with another autoimmune disease. We present the case of a man who, one month after his recovery from acute moderate COVID-19, presented concurrent GBS and ITP with an adequate response to treatment.
Durante la infección aguda por el SARVS-CoV-2 se produce una desregulación del sistema inmune que puede durar hasta ocho meses después de controlado el cuadro agudo.

A total of 120 children with ITP who were admitted from October 2019 to October 2021 were enrolled as the ITP group. A total of 60 children without ITP were enrolled as the non-ITP group. According to the clinical classification of ITP, the children in the ITP group were further divided into a newly diagnosed ITP group, a persistent ITP group, and a chronic ITP group. The clinical data were compared between the ITP group and the non-ITP group and between the children with different clinical classifications of ITP. The expression levels of serum TGAb and TPOAb in children with ITP were measured and their association with the clinical classification of ITP was analyzed.

Interleukin 27 (IL-27) plays pleiotropic roles in immunomodulation and autoimmune diseases.We aimed to determine the level of IL-27 in patients with ITP and its relationship to patient and disease characteristics as well as disease chronicity and response to treatment.Sixty childrens with primary immune thrombocytopenia were consequetively enrolled in this study as well as 20 age and sex matched healthy controls.ITP patients had significantly higher levels of IL-27 than controls (770.6 and 373.8 pg/ml, respectively). Patients with acute ITP had the highest levels of IL-27 among patient groups, while patients in remission had the lowest IL-27 levels (860.1and 622.9 pg/ml, respectively). Patients who received IVIG and combined steroids plus IVIG had significantly higher IL-27 levels than others. Patients who received Eltrombopag had significantly lower IL-27 levels than others.IL-27 seems to play a role in pathogenesis of childhood ITP. IL-27 can be used as a predictor for disease occurrence as well as responsiveness to treatment."
35751575,Frequency and utility of bone marrow examination in relapsed/refractory immune thrombocytopenia.,"The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is one of exclusion. Although guidelines recommend against routine bone marrow examination (BME) at time of ITP diagnosis, the role of BME in relapsed/refractory ITP is unclear.
To examine the frequency and predictors of BME in relapsed/refractory ITP.
This multicenter retrospective cohort study included adults with ITP who received second-line therapy in Alberta, Canada from 2012 to 2019. We calculated the frequency of BME and rate of abnormal marrow findings. Logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of BME and predictors of bone marrow pathology.
Of 324 patients with presumed ITP, 181 (56%) underwent BME. We observed a marked decline in the rates of BME among patients >60 years over the past decade, but not in patients younger than age 60 years. On multivariable logistic regression, older age (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.03, p = .0001), anemia (aOR 2.5, p = .01), splenomegaly (aOR 3.2, p = .01), splenectomy (aOR 2.4, p = .02), and lack of splenectomy response (aOR 3.4, p = .04) were significant predictors of BME. Abnormal marrow findings were found in eight (2% of overall cohort; 4% of BME): four myelodysplastic syndrome, one aplastic anemia, one chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one metastatic cancer, and one megaloblastic anemia. Seven (88%) underwent BME for bicytopenias/pancytopenias. Macrocytosis (aOR 9.6, p = .03) and rural residence (aOR 6.7, p = .02) were independent predictors of abnormal bone marrow findings.
Although routine BME is frequently performed in relapsed/refractory ITP, abnormal findings are rare. Future prospective studies are needed to help identify a subgroup of relapsed/refractory ITP who may benefit from BME."

35747766,An Immunologic Storm: A Case of Encephalitis and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura With Underlying Likely Sjogren's Syndrome Induced by a COVID-19 Immune Response.,"There are rare cases of Sjogren's syndrome presenting with manifestations of encephalitis. There are also rare patients with Sjogren's presenting with acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). There are no cases of both occurring together as the only symptoms of the syndrome. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more cases of autoimmunity are being described given its robust immune response. It is important to keep a wide differential about these varying clinical presentations.
Our patient is a 19-year-old female with a history of menorrhagia, recent COVID-19 infection, and remote suicidal ideation. She presented with headaches, vomiting, and psychosis. Her labs found platelets of 12,000 and she was soon discovered to have TTP. She was found to have contrast enhancing lesions scattered in her left hemisphere on magnetic resonance imaging as well as seizures. Her workup was negative for infection, but labs revealed a positive antinuclear antibody, elevated anti-Ro antibody (anti-SSA) and anti-La antibody (anti-SSB), and elevated COVID-19 antibodies. She was treated with antiepileptics, pulse dose steroids for 5 days, plasmapheresis, and weekly rituximab for 4 weeks. She had significant clinical improvement.
Sjogren's syndrome can have varying presentations including TTP with or without encephalitis as a presenting feature. Autoimmunity can also be triggered from COVID-19 infection."
35746569,COVID-19 Vaccines and Autoimmune Hematologic Disorders.,"Worldwide vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has allowed the detection of hematologic autoimmune complications. Adverse events (AEs) of this nature had been previously observed in association with other vaccines. The underlying mechanisms are not totally understood, although mimicry between viral and self-antigens plays a relevant role. It is important to remark that, although the incidence of these AEs is extremely low, their evolution may lead to life-threatening scenarios if treatment is not readily initiated. Hematologic autoimmune AEs have been associated with both mRNA and adenoviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The main reported entities are secondary immune thrombocytopenia, immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans syndrome, and a newly described disorder, so-called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The hallmark of VITT is the presence of anti-platelet factor 4 autoantibodies able to trigger platelet activation. Patients with VITT present with thrombocytopenia and may develop thrombosis in unusual locations such as cerebral beds. The management of hematologic autoimmune AEs does not differ significantly from that of these disorders in a non-vaccine context, thus addressing autoantibody production and bleeding/thromboembolic risk. This means that clinicians must be aware of their distinctive signs in order to diagnose them and initiate treatment as soon as possible."

Current therapies primarily focus on reducing antiplatelet antibodies using immunosuppression or increasing platelet production with thrombopoietin mimetics. However, there are no universally safe and effective treatments for patients presenting with severe life-threatening bleeding. The IgG-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS), a protease with strict specificity for IgG, prevents IgG-driven immune disorders in murine models, including ITP. In clinical trials, IdeS prevented IgG-mediated kidney transplant rejection; however, the concentration of IdeS used to remove pathogenic antibodies causes profound hypogammaglobulinemia, and IdeS is immunogenic, which limits its use. Therefore, this study sought to determine whether targeting IdeS to FcγRIIA, a low-affinity IgG receptor on the surface of platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes, would be a viable strategy to decrease the pathogenesis of antiplatelet IgG and reduce treatment-related complications of nontargeted IdeS. We generated a recombinant protein conjugate by site-specifically linking the C-terminus of a single-chain variable fragment from an FcγRIIA antibody, clone IV.3, to the N-terminus of IdeS (scIV.3-IdeS). Platelets treated with scIV.3-IdeS had reduced binding of antiplatelet IgG from patients with ITP and decreased platelet phagocytosis in vitro, with no decrease in normal IgG. Treatment of mice expressing human FcγRIIA with scIV.3-IdeS reduced thrombocytopenia in a model of ITP and significantly improved the half-life of transfused platelets expressing human FcγRIIA. Together, these data suggest that scIV.3-IdeS can selectively remove pathogenic antiplatelet IgG and may be a potential treatment for patients with ITP and severe bleeding."

Besides platelet count, immature platelet fraction (IPF) can be used as a tool to predict megakaryocytic activity in ITP patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of extended platelet indices in ITP diagnosis and their association with disease persistence and severity. This case-control study (1:1), conducted from January 2015 to December 2017, included 111 ITP patients and 111 healthy controls. ITP patients were grouped as newly diagnosed ITP, persistent ITP, chronic ITP, and refractory ITP patients. Peripheral blood was collected and complete blood profile parameters were recorded using Sysmex XN 1000. Significant (p≤0.05) difference between the groups of ITP patients and healthy control subjects was determined by Fisher exact test, while Pearson correlation was used to evaluate platelet count correlation with IPF using SPSS ver. 23. Low hemoglobin and platelet counts with high total leukocyte count and IPF were detected in ITP patients as compared to healthy subjects (p≤0.001). Among all groups of ITP patients, very low platelet count (6.9±6.02.x10"

Severe thrombocytopenia is a relatively rare hematologic manifestation of sarcoidosis. Immune thrombocytopenia is usually characterized by excessive antibody production leading to platelet destruction. There are a few reported cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura secondary to sarcoidosis, but the pathophysiologic mechanism remains unknown. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented severe thrombocytopenia and was found to have immune thrombocytopenic purpura secondary to sarcoidosis."
35731071,Effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on the first-line treatment outcomes in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is known to increase the platelet count, but in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the effect of H. pylori infection on the response to treatment is not clear. This study aims to determine whether the response to the first-line treatment is affected by the states of H. pylori-positivity and -negativity in ITP patients.
Adult newly diagnosed or chronic ITP patients who had not received eradication therapy for H. pylori infection were included. Characteristics of the patients, presence and severity of bleeding, initial platelet count, administered treatments, and treatment response rates were inspected.
Of 119 total patients, 66 (55.5%) were female, 32 (26.9%) were H. pylori-positive, 87 (73.1%) were H. pylori-negative. H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative groups were not significantly different in terms of age (p=0.127), gender (p=0.078), diagnosis status (p=0.094) and the distribution of bleeding symptoms (p=0.712). The most common treatment was standard-dose steroid in both groups (62.5% vs. 68.9%, p=0.524). Rates of complete response, partial response, no response were comparable for the two groups (respectively, 75% vs. 73.6%, and 18.8% vs. 19.5%, and 6.2% vs. 6.9%), and there was no significant difference between the groups (p=0.283).
It can be stated according to the present study that in ITP patients in whom treatment is indicated, the response to the first-line treatment without the administration of H. pylori eradication therapy is similar between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients."

Occasionally, an inciting event such as a virus or vaccination can precipitate ITP. Several cases of ITP have been reported after the BTN162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines. All reported cases of post-vaccination ITP have resolved with medical therapy until this case.A man in his mid-20s developed bleeding from ITP 2 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All inpatient medical treatment attempts failed. On hospital day 40, a splenectomy was performed and he ultimately recovered and was discharged.Awareness of potential vaccination side effects is a fundamental element of refining and improving patient safety. This case illustrates that given the right circumstances, serious refractory ITP can develop in response to the second dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."

Using the ACS-NSQIP database, patients undergoing splenectomy for ITP were identified (2005-2019), and those with and without postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery were compared.
Of 2483 patients evaluated, 280 (11.3%) developed 30-day morbidity: infection (n= 145 [5.8%]), venous thromboembolism (n = 71 [2.9%]), acute renal failure (n = 7 [0.3%]), respiratory failure (n = 40 [1.6%]), cardiac arrest/myocardial infarction (n = 16 [0.6%]), cerebrovascular accident (n = 4 [0.2%]), or postoperative blood transfusion (n = 62 [2.5%]). Risk-factors for 30-day morbidity included age ≥50 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.50, p = 0.020), body mass index ≥30 kg/m
Thirty-day morbidity and mortality are low with splenectomy for ITP. Select patients have particularly low perioperative risk and may benefit from early splenectomy if initial medical therapy fails."

We very briefly summarize first-line treatment and then utilize a case-based approach. We first explore persistent, chronic ITP in a younger female. We consider many possibilities beyond primary ITP e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic infection, and anemia, and how to approach their diagnosis and management. The journey continues throughout pregnancy and the post-partum period and eventually includes fourth-line treatment after a late relapse. We then consider an older male, emphasizing differences in diagnostic considerations and management. The focus is on initiation and continuation of second-line treatment, the pros and cons of each option, and briefly the impact of treatment choices related to the endemic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. During the review of potential second-line treatment options, we also briefly touch upon novel treatments. Finally, there is a short section on refractory disease drawn from our previous extensive review published in February 2020.1 The clinical nature of the discussions, replete with figures and tables and with the interspersion of pearls regarding efficacy and toxicity at different ages and genders, will serve the reader in the management of ""typical"" adult patients who develop persistent and chronic ITP."

The spleen is pivotal in the pathogenesis of ITP, yet little is known on its immune microenvironment and on effects of TPO-RA on this organ. To address these topics, we analysed 35 spleens removed for primary refractory ITP. Pre-splenectomy TPO-RA administration correlated with increased splenic regulatory T cells (Tregs), type 2 T-helper cells and histiocyte density and with reduced red pulp sinusoids. Surgical outcome was not associated with TPO-RA administration, other pre-splenectomy therapies and/or Treg density. In conclusion, TPO-RA affect the splenic microenvironment, but this has no impact on splenectomy outcome."

The clinical importance of these SNPs is unknown.
To investigate whether SNPs in NR3C1a are associated with clinical outcome in Cocker Spaniels with primary immune thrombocytopenia (pITP).
Twenty-four Cocker Spaniels with pITP presented to a referral center. Dogs were classified as slow (n = 11) or fast responders (n = 12) based on time required after initiating glucocorticoid treatment to achieve a platelet count >70 000/μL.
Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from stored blood samples before amplification by PCR and sequencing of exons 2 and 8 of NR3C1a. Associations between genotype and clinical response variables were investigated.
Neither previously identified nonsynonymous SNPs were identified. The synonymous SNP NR3C1a:c.798C>T in exon 2 was found at an increased prevalence compared to a previous report. No difference was found in prevalence of any genotype at NR3C1a:c.798C>T between fast and slow responders (P = .70).
None of the previously reported nonsynonymous SNPs in exons 2 and 8 of the NR3C1a gene were detected in our cohort of Cocker Spaniels with pITP. The synonymous SNP NR3C1a:c.798C>T in exon 2 was reported at a higher frequency than previously, but was not associated with outcome measures that estimated responsiveness to glucocorticoids."

Therapy for ITP relies on competing and inhibiting the autoantibody binding and destruction (intravenous immunoglobulin and anti-D immunoglobulin and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor fostamatinib), augmenting platelet production (thrombopoietin receptor agonists), immunosuppression to reduce the autoantibody production, as well as splenectomy.

Eleven male and 23 female patients with the diagnosis of primary ITP in our hospital from November 2018 to October 2019 were enrolled and randomly divided into test group (17 cases) and control group (17 cases), the median age was 52 years old (range: 20-76 years old). The patients in test group were treated with rhTPO 300 IU/(kg·d) combined with glucocorticoid , while the patients in control group were treated with rhTPO (15 000 IU/d) combined with glucocorticoid. Platelet count, platelet increase, as well as the overall response rate were compared. At the same time, the drug tolerance and any adverse drug reactions were observed.
The platelet counts and platelet increase of the patients in the test group were significantly higher than those in control group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in platelet counts and platelet increase between the patients in the test group and control group at day 3, 7 after treatment. There was no significant difference in overall response rates and complete response rates at day 7, 14 between the two groups either. In test group, there were 13 cases received platelet transfusion, while 12 cases in control group. The muscle aches occurred in one patient, and mild aminotransferase increased in another patient in test group which was self-recovery without treatment.
RhTPO 300 U/(kg·d) combined with glucocorticoid could rapidly increase the platelet count with a low incidence of tolerable adverse events compared with conventional dose rhTPO with glucocorticoid.

However, its mortality and related risk factors remain unclear. Herein, we conducted a nationwide multicenter real-world study of ICH in adult ITP patients. According to data from 27 centers in China from 2005 to 2020, the mortality rate from ICH was 33.80% (48/142) in ITP adults. We identified risk factors by logistic univariate and multivariate logistic regression for 30-day mortality in a training cohort of 107 patients as follows: intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), platelet count ≤10 × 109/L at ICH, a combination of serious infections, grade of preceding bleeding events, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) level on admission. Accordingly, a prognostic model of 30-day mortality was developed based on the regression equation. Then, we evaluated the performance of the prognostic model through a bootstrap procedure for internal validation. Furthermore, an external validation with data from a test cohort with 35 patients from 11 other centers was conducted. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the internal and external validation were 0.954 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.910-0.998) and 0.942 (95% CI, 0.871-1.014), respectively. Both calibration plots illustrated a high degree of consistency in the estimated and observed risk. In addition, the decision curve analysis showed a considerable net benefit for patients. Thus, an application (47.94.162.105:8080/ich/) was established for users to predict 30-day mortality when ICH occurred in adult patients with ITP."

Analysis of ILQI responses indicated differences between Western and non-Western countries. The objective of this study was to translate and linguistically validate the ILQI for Japan and France.
The ILQI underwent dual forwards/backwards translation with reconciliation and resolution. The translations were reviewed prior to conducting cognitive interviews with ITP patients (n = 5 Japan, n = 5 France). Analysis of interview transcripts highlighted required modifications to the ILQI translations. Japanese and French ITP experts reviewed the final translations for cultural relevance and appropriateness.
Most of the Japanese and French forward/backwards translations were reconciled with no revision. The ILQI instructions and items were well understood by Japanese and French participants. Wording in one item of the Japanese version of the ILQI was revised to better align with the source instrument. Three terms/phrases in the French translation were revised due to misunderstanding, being deemed inaccurate or culturally inappropriate. Following review by ITP experts from Japan and France, minor modifications were made.
Findings confirm the linguistic validity of the ILQI in Japanese and French."
35670140,Incidence of adult primary immune thrombocytopenia in England-An update.,"Adult primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare bleeding disorder of unknown cause. Recent estimates of its incidence and trend over time were acquired for England.
The primary ITP population (using ICD 10 code D693 and excluding secondary ITP cases; positive predictive value: 82.6%) was sourced from NHS Digital inpatient and outpatient. Incidence rate (IR) for England and by age groups, sex, and regions were calculated and trends were assessed using average annual percent change (AAPC).
A total of 25 805 patients (mean age 59 years; females 57.8%) diagnosed between 2003 and 2014 was identified. IRs increased from 4.2/100 000 to 6.4/100 000 over this period (AAPC:4.3%). For all sex-specific age groups, the IRs significantly increased over time, except 18-29 years males. The greatest increase was among females aged 30-39 (AAPC:8.7%). In contrast, among ≥70 years, ITP was more common in males (highest IR among ≥80 years males: 23.9/100 000). England's average annual IR was 6.1/100 000 for 2010-14. An estimated 2.5/100 000 (based on UKITP Registry data) was estimated to require 1st line treatment whereas 2.4/100 000 would have 1st and 2nd line treatments within 6 months from diagnosis. IRs for London and East Midlands were the highest (6.5/100 000).
This study found a rising incidence of primary ITP, with sharp increases among young women and elderly men. These findings put in context the impact of ITP on patients' lives and the healthcare services in England, especially with 17%-50% who may develop chronic ITP and require long-term care."
35667044,How I treat immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura after hospital discharge.,"Immune-mediated thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by an acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency as a result of the presence of an antibody inhibitor of ADAMTS13 leading to the formation of ultralarge von Willebrand multimers. Treatment of iTTP includes plasma exchange, high-dose glucocorticoids, rituximab, and, more recently, caplacizumab, to prevent the development of exacerbations. There is the risk of both relapse and long-term complications that include neurocognitive deficits and cardiovascular events that occur in patients in remission after recovery from an acute iTTP episode. Data on the risk factors for the development of these complications, the appropriate screening, and treatment are limited due to the paucity of research. This article is a review of the current understanding on the risk factors for exacerbation, relapse, and long-term complications of iTTP and discusses an approach to observing patients with iTTP after hospital discharge and during the long-term follow-up in the outpatient setting."

In HIT, anti-PF4 antibodies induced by heparin exposure cause thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. However, in recent years, autoimmune HIT (aHIT) that develops without heparin exposure has been getting attention. In 2021, anti-PF4 antibodies were reported to cause the fatal vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) that developed after adenoviral vector vaccination for COVID-19. HIT, aHIT, and VITT are considered to be caused by anti-PF4 antibodies, and their pathological conditions are similar. However, they have different levels of severity, and the detection sensitivity of their antibodies varies depending on the assay. Herein, we review three pathologies, namely, HIT, aHIT, and VITT, associated with anti-PF4 antibodies."
35662003,Menstrual problems in chronic immune thrombocytopenia: A monthly challenge - a cohort study and review.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may cause menstrual problems. This cross-sectional study assessed menstrual problems in premenopausal chronic ITP women by several questionnaires, including the pictorial bleeding assessment calendar (PBAC; score ≥100 indicates heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]), and the menorrhagia multiattribute scale (MMAS). Spearman was used for assessing correlations. A literature review was performed in Pubmed. The cohort comprised 37 women (mean age 31 ± 9). A total of 29/37 (78%) had experienced clinical menstrual problems in the present or past. Of the 33 patients who returned the PBAC, 13 (39%) had a score of ≥100. The median MMAS score was 79 (IQR 60-95). The PBAC scores correlated with the MMAS. Both questionnaires were unrelated to the platelet count. Patients with a levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) had lower PBAC scores than patients with other or no hormonal therapy. MMAS scores were correlated with fatigue. The review identified 14 papers. HMB occurred in 6%-55% at ITP diagnosis and 17%-79% during disease. Menstrual symptoms influenced the quality of life, particularly in patients with a low platelet count. This explorative study suggested that HMB is frequent in women with chronic ITP despite management and platelet counts >50 *10"

Thrombus formation in iTTP is related to a severe deficiency of the specific von Willebrand-factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 due to ADAMTS13 autoantibodies.
We present a case of iTTP following exposure to the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty
Apart from our case, twenty cases of iTTP occurring after COVID-19 vaccination had been published until the end of November 2021. There were 11 male and 10 female cases; their median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 14-84 years). Five patients (24%) had a preexisting history of iTTP. Recombinant adenoviral vector-based vaccines were involved in 19%, mRNA-based vaccines in 81%. The median onset of symptoms after vaccination was 12 days (range 5-37), with 20 cases presenting within 30 days. Treatment included therapeutic plasma exchange in all patients. Additional rituximab, caplacizumab, or both these treatments were given in 43% (9/21), 14% (3/21), and 24% (5/21) of cases, respectively. One patient died, despite a prolonged clinical course in one patient, all surviving patients were in clinical remission at the end of the observational period.
Clinical features of iTTP following COVID-19 vaccination were in line with those of pre-pandemic iTTP. When timely initiated, an excellent response to standard treatment was seen in all cases. ADAMTS13 activity should be determined pre-vaccination in patients with a history of a previous iTTP episode. None of the reported cases met the WHO criteria for assessing an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) as a consistent causal association to immunization. Further surveillance of safety data and additional case-based assessment are needed."
35655776,Underlying Inborn Errors of Immunity in Patients With Evans Syndrome and Multilineage Cytopenias: A Single-Centre Analysis.,"Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare disorder classically defined as the simultaneous or sequential presence of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and immune thrombocytopenia, but it has also been described as the presence of at least two autoimmune cytopenias. Recent reports have shown that ES is often a manifestation of an underlying inborn error of immunity (IEI) that can benefit from specific treatments.
The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and immunological characteristics and the underlying genetic background of a single-centre cohort of patients with ES.
Data were obtained from a retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosis of ES followed in our centre. Genetic studies were performed with NGS analysis of 315 genes related to both haematological and immunological disorders, in particular IEI.
Between 1985 and 2020, 40 patients (23 men, 17 women) with a median age at onset of 6 years (range 0-16) were studied. ES was concomitant and sequential in 18 (45%) and 22 (55%) patients, respectively. Nine of the 40 (8%) patients had a positive family history of autoimmunity. Other abnormal immunological features and signs of lymphoproliferation were present in 24/40 (60%) and 27/40 (67%) of cases, respectively. Seventeen out of 40 (42%) children fit the ALPS diagnostic criteria. The remaining 21 (42%) and 2 (5%) were classified as having an ALPS-like and an idiopathic disease, respectively. Eighteen patients (45%) were found to have an underlying genetic defect on genes 
This study shows that nearly half of patients with ES have a genetic background being in most cases secondary to IEI, and therefore, a molecular evaluation should be offered to all patients."
35654406,Immune Thrombocytopenia: Characteristics of the Population and Treatment Methods-One-Center Experience.," Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disease with variable clinical presentation, requiring different treatment lines.
 The study aimed to characterize a group of ITP patients in terms of clinical picture and disease treatment, as well as to present the current standard of care of ITP in Poland, in the context of local and international guidelines.
 The study included adult patients diagnosed with ITP, treated at the Department of Haematology of the Jagiellonian University Hospital in Krakow from January 2006 to January 2021. Patient characteristics, clinical manifestation of ITP, and treatment methods were analyzed.
 A total of 245 ITP patients were included. 57.1% of them were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Most common symptoms were thrombocytopenic purpura (68.2%), followed by epistaxis (34.7%) and gum bleeds (19.2%). Life-threatening bleedings were noted in three cases (1.2%). 23.2% of patients did not require treatment. Prednisone was the most commonly used first-line therapy (75.5% of patients). Treatment with eltrombopag and romiplostim was used in 40.4 and 8.5% of patients requiring second-line therapy, respectively. 14.3% of all patients ultimately underwent splenectomy, including 51.5% of those who needed second-line treatment. The initial response rate was 74.3%; however, post-splenectomy relapses occurred in 22.9% of patients.
 ITP is a disease of mild clinical course, often asymptomatic. Chronic disease often requires multiple treatment lines and balancing between bleeding risk and treatment toxicity, based on individual risk-benefit assessment. Local access restrictions to thrombopoietin receptor agonists determined the treatment strategy.

Eltrombopag und Romiplostim waren in 40.4% und 8.5% der Patienten verabreicht, die eine Zweitlinientherapie benötigten. Splenektomie wurde in 14.3% aller Patienten durchgeführt und in 51.5% deren, in denen Zweitlinientherapie nötig war. Die initiale Ansprechrate auf Splenektomie war 74.3%, jedoch 22.9% der Patienten erlitten ein Rückfall. CONCLUSãO:  Das klinische Bild von ITP ist mild, oft symptomfrei. Chronische Krankheit benötigt dagegen oft viele Therapielinien. Balancieren zwischen Blutungsrisiko und Toxizität der Therapie ist nonwendig, anhand der individuellen Nutzen/Risiko-Abwägung. Lokale Einschränkungen der Verfügbarkeit der Thrombopoetin-Rezeptoragonisten determinierten die Therapiestrategie."

Since platelet responses are reported in some patients with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive ITP after eradication, we conducted a multicenter, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recently established sequential eradication for these patients having moderate thrombocytopenia.

35642486,Treatment of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias.,"Several therapeutic agents can cause thrombocytopenia by either immune-mediated or non-immune-mediated mechanisms. Non-immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is due to direct toxicity of drug molecules to platelets or megakaryocytes. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, on the other hand, involves the formation of antibodies that react to platelet-specific glycoprotein complexes, as in classic drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP), or to platelet factor 4, as in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Clinical signs include a rapid drop in platelet count, bleeding or thrombosis. Since the patient's condition can deteriorate rapidly, prompt diagnosis and management are critical. However, the necessary diagnostic tests are only available in specialized laboratories. Therefore, the most demanding step in treatment is to identify the agent responsible for thrombocytopenia, which often proves difficult because many patients are taking multiple medications and have comorbidities that can themselves also cause thrombocytopenia. While DITP is commonly associated with an increased risk of bleeding, HIT and VITT have a high mortality rate due to the high incidence of thromboembolic complications. A structured approach to drug-associated thrombocytopenia/thrombosis can lead to successful treatment and a lower mortality rate. In addition to describing the treatment of DITP, HIT, VITT, and vaccine-associated immune thrombocytopenia, this review also provides the pathophysiological and clinical information necessary for correct patient management."
35638196,Simultaneous Occurrence of Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia and Myocarditis After mRNA-1273 COVID-19 Vaccination: A Case Report.,"With the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, several vaccines were developed; messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have recently been widely used worldwide. However, the incidence of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination is increasing; although the cause of myocarditis has not yet been clearly identified, it is presumed to be caused by a problem in the innate immune system. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) after vaccination is rare but has been reported and is also assumed to occur by the same mechanism. We report the first case of simultaneous myocarditis and ITP after mRNA vaccination. A 38-year-old woman presented with chest pain, mild dyspnea, and sweating after vaccination with mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) 4 days prior to admission. Upon admission to the emergency department, cardiac enzymes were elevated; blood test performed 5 months ago showed normal platelet count, but severe thrombocytopenia was observed upon admission. After administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, the platelet count improved; subsequently, myocarditis was observed on endomyocardial biopsy. Thus, myocarditis and ITP were judged to have occurred simultaneously due to the expression of the innate immune system markers after mRNA vaccination. The patient was discharged on day 6 of admission."
35637831,"Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Intracerebral Hemorrhage, Incidence, and Mortality.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating complication of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Using a large database, we sought to determine its incidence and mortality.
We used a de-identified database (TriNetX) to gather information on patients with ITP with subsequent ICH (cohort 1), propensity score-matched with patients with ITP and no ICH (cohort 2). Primary endpoint was mortality, with secondary endpoints of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, craniotomy, palliative care encounters, intensive care unit (ICU) management, seizure, falls, pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), ischemic stroke (IS), and other venous embolism and thrombosis (VTE).
Incidence of ICH in patients with ITP was 1.540% in all ages, and 0.774% in those under age 18. After matching, 942 patients from each cohort were identified. Mean age was 58.3 years versus 61.2 years in cohort 1 and 2, respectively. Mortality rate was 34.076% vs. 20.17% (p <0.0001, OR 2.046 with 95% CI 1.661,2.520) at five years. Thirty-day survival was 83.46% vs. 95.17% (p<0.0001), and 365-day survival 68.59% vs. 85.33% (p<0.0001). PEG placement was seen in 21 (2.229%) patients in cohort 1, and less than 10 patients (<1.062%) in cohort 2 (p<0.0464). 2.442% vs. 0% underwent craniotomy (p<0.0001), palliative care was involved in 15.711% vs. 7.962% (p<0.0001), ICU care was seen in 27.389% vs. 11.783% (p<0.0001), with a mean ICU stay of 8.075 vs. 5.812 days (p=0.0537). 6.582% vs. 3.715% had PE (p=0.0049), 7.643% vs. 7.113% experienced MI (p=0.6595), 9.236% vs. 4.883% had DVTs (p=0.0002), 23.673% vs. 5.732% had seizures (p<0.0001), 9.023% vs. 6.582% suffered falls (p=0.0482), 7.537% vs. 3.503% suffered IS (p<0.0001), and 15.074% vs. 8.174% experienced other VTE (p<0.0001).
ICH occurs in approximately 1.54% of ITP patients, and is associated with a 34% mortality rate, increased PEG tube placement rates, palliative care involvement, ICU care, craniotomy, PE, IS, DVT, seizures, and falls."
35637282,ADAP restraint of STAT1 signaling regulates macrophage phagocytosis in immune thrombocytopenia.,"Heightened platelet phagocytosis by macrophages accompanied by an increase in IFN-γ play key roles in the etiology of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); however, it remains elusive how macrophage-mediated platelet clearance is regulated in ITP. Here, we report that adhesion and degranulation-protein adaptor protein (ADAP) restrains platelet phagocytosis by macrophages in ITP via modulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-FcγR signaling. We show that ITP was associated with the underexpression of ADAP in splenic macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages from Adap"
35635598,Serum Copper and Zinc Levels in Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Although the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia is not fully known, oxidative stress is one of the etiological causes. Copper and zinc are elements in the antioxidant system, and their deficiency causes oxidative stress. We aimed to determine the serum copper and zinc levels and their effects on the response to treatment in patients with immune thrombocytopenia. We analyzed 51 patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia and 33 control cases. Age, gender, and platelet values at the time of diagnosis, drugs used for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia, remission status, and serum copper and zinc levels were recorded. The primary immune thrombocytopenia and control groups were compared in terms of serum copper and zinc levels. In addition, the relationship between the response status to the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenia and serum copper and zinc levels was investigated. The serum zinc level in the immune thrombocytopenia group and control group was 10.35 ± 3.28 µmol/L and 12.82 ± 2.41 µmol/L, respectively (p = 0.01). The serum copper level in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (77.3 ± 22.23 µg/dL) was significantly lower than the control group (99.4 ± 20.82 µg/dL) (p = 0.01). A significant correlation was found between the response to first-line treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia and serum copper level (p = 0.005). The serum copper level was significantly lower in relapsed cases (p = 0.001). In conclusion, serum copper and zinc levels are lower in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia than in healthy cases. Patients with relapsed or unresponsive to immune thrombocytopenia treatment have lower serum copper levels than other patients."
35633950,Novel Mutations in ACP5 and SAMHD1 in a Patient With Pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"The study of genetic predisposition to pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) has brought new insights into the pathophysiology of SLE, as it is hypothesized that genetic predisposition is greater in children. Furthermore, identifying genetic variants and linking disrupted genes to abnormal immune pathways and clinical manifestations can be beneficial for both diagnosis and treatment. Here, we identified genetic alterations in a patient with childhood-onset SLE and analyzed the immunological mechanisms behind them to support future diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
Whole exome sequencing (WES) was adopted for genetic analysis of a patient with childhood-onset SLE. Gene mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Clinical data of this patient were collected and summarized. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to provide interacting genes of the perturbed genes. Online Enrichr tool and Cytoscape software were used to analysis the related pathways of these genes.
We present a case of a 2-year-old girl who was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and SLE. The patient was characterized by cutaneous bleeding spots on both lower extremities, thrombocytopenia, decreased serum complements levels, increased urinary red blood cells, and positive ANA and dsDNA. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and mycophenolate, but clinical remission could not be achieved. The genomic analysis identified three novel mutations in this pSLE patient, a double-stranded missense mutation in ACP5 (c.1152G>T and c.420G>A) and a single-stranded mutation in SAMHD1 (c.1423G>A). Bioinformatic analysis showed that these two genes and their interacting genes are enriched in the regulation of multiple immune pathways associated with SLE, including cytokine signaling and immune cell activation or function. Analysis of the synergistic regulation of these two genes suggests that abnormalities in the type I interferon pathway caused by genetic variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE.
The combined complexity of polymorphisms in the coding regions of ACP5 and SAMHD1 influences the susceptibility to SLE. Alterations in these genes may lead to abnormalities in the type I interferon pathway. Our study extends the spectrum of mutations in the ACP5 and SAMHD1 genes. The identification of these mutations could aid in the diagnosis of SLE with genetic counseling and suggest potential precise treatments for specific pathways."
35633238,Evans Syndrome: A Case Report.,"Evans syndrome is defined as the concomitant or sequential association of warm autoimmune hemolytic anaemia with immune thrombocytopenia, and less frequently autoimmune neutropenia. It is associated with non-cross-reacting auto-antibodies directed against antigens specific to red blood cells, platelets or neutrophils. Clinical symptoms could be related to hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. Evans syndrome is a rare diagnosis of exclusion. The first-line treatment of Evans syndrome is intravenous corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins and second-line treatment with rituximab or splenectomy for those who are refractory to steroids. Here is a case of a fifty-year-old- female who presented with bleeding from the mouth and gums, bluish patches over the shin and trunk along with generalised weakness and severe backache. We are interested in reporting this case because the presentation of patients with such scenarios on our part will compel the treating physician to overlook Evans syndrome and get it underdiagnosed.

35622986,Immature Platelet Fraction and Its Kinetics in Neonates.,"Thrombocytopenia is a common abnormality encountered in the neonatal period, and immature platelet fraction (IPF) may be an informative indicator of thrombopoiesis; however, data on IPF in neonates are scarce. To define reference intervals (RIs) and factors affecting IPF in neonates, we measured the IPF of 533 consecutive neonates. With a multiple regression analysis of 330 newborns with normal platelet counts at birth, premature delivery, neonatal asphyxia, intrauterine infection, chromosomal abnormalities, and respiratory disorders were identified as independent factors for IPF%. The RIs of IPF% and absolute IPF value in neonates were determined to be 1.3% to 5.7% and 3.2 to 14.5×10 9 /L, respectively. On day 14 after birth, IPF% increased to twice the value at birth and thereafter returned to the previous value on day 28. Reticulocyte counts, in contrast, were the lowest at day 14. IPF% was increased in 16 thrombocytopenic patients with various clinical conditions, especially those with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. IPF in neonates may be evaluated essentially based on the same RIs as in adults, although some precautions must be taken when evaluating IPF in neonates in the first 2 weeks of life. IPF may be useful for evaluating thrombopoiesis and thrombocytopenia in neonates."
35621338,Evaluating fostamatinib disodium as a treatment option for immune thrombocytopenia in adult patients.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production, leading to thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding manifestations. The majority of patients experiencing treatment need will eventually need secondary treatment following first-line therapy with steroids. In 2018, the oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib received US Food and Drug Administration approval for ITP patients with an insufficient response to a previous treatment.
This review outlines pharmacological characteristics of fostamatinib and provides an overview of its efficacy and safety results in phase II and III trials, followed by the expert opinion of the authors.
Increasing knowledge on the role of different players and mechanisms in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders, in general, and of ITP, in particular, has led to the development of several new treatment options, as illustrated by the introduction of fostamatinib in the treatment of ITP. However, lacking direct comparison with other recent treatment options (in particular, thrombopoietin receptor agonists), its use should be evaluated critically taking into account the unique toxicity and potential drug-drug interaction profile."
35619694,Insights Into Immunothrombotic Mechanisms in Acute Stroke due to Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination is the most important countermeasure. Pharmacovigilance concerns however emerged with very rare, but potentially disastrous thrombotic complications following vaccination with ChAdOx1. Platelet factor-4 antibody mediated vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) was described as an underlying mechanism of these thrombotic events. Recent work moreover suggests that mechanisms of immunothrombosis including neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation might be critical for thrombogenesis during VITT. In this study, we investigated blood and thrombus specimens of a female patient who suffered severe stroke due to VITT after vaccination with ChAdOx1 in comparison to 13 control stroke patients with similar clinical characteristics. We analyzed cerebral thrombi using histological examination, staining of complement factors, NET-markers, DNase and LL-37. In blood samples at the hyper-acute phase of stroke and 7 days later, we determined cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-histone complexes, DNase activity, myeloperoxidase activity, LL-37 and inflammatory cytokines. NET markers were identified in thrombi of all patients. Interestingly, the thrombus of the VITT-patient exclusively revealed complement factors and high amounts of DNase and LL-37. High DNase activity was also measured in blood, implying a disturbed NET-regulation. Furthermore, serum of the VITT-patient inhibited reactive oxygen species-dependent NET-release by phorbol-myristate-acetate to a lesser degree compared to controls, indicating either less efficient NET-inhibition or enhanced NET-induction in the blood of the VITT-patient. Additionally, the changes in specific cytokines over time were emphasized in the VITT-patient as well. In conclusion, insufficient resolution of NETs, e.g. by endogenous DNases or protection of NETs against degradation by embedded factors like the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 might thus be an important factor in the pathology of VITT besides increased NET-formation. On the basis of these findings, we discuss the potential implications of the mechanisms of disturbed NETs-degradation for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in VITT-related thrombogenesis, other auto-immune disorders and beyond."
35615916,Alternatives for managing patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a narrative review.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired bleeding disorder. Conventionally, first-line ITP therapy aims to obtain a rapid response and stop or decrease the risk of bleeding by increasing the platelet count. At this point, the duration of the response, the tolerability, and the long-term safety of pharmacologic interventions are considered less of a priority. Combination treatments that simultaneously address multiple disease mechanisms are an attractive strategy to increase efficacy in acute ITP therapy. In this review, we discuss the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP patients, emphasizing the use of new combinations to benefit from their synergy.
This article summarizes conventional treatment, recent and novel combinations, and COVID-19 management recommendations of newly diagnosed ITP patients.
The key areas for improvement consider the long-term effects of conventional first-line therapy, reducing relapse rates, and extending responses to achieve long-term remission. Although corticosteroids remain a first-line therapy, restricting their use to avoid toxicity and the increasing use of rituximab and TPO-RAs in the first three months after diagnosis open the landscape for future interventions in frontline therapy for ITP. First-line therapy intensification or synergistic drug combination offers a potential and realistic shift in future treatment guidelines."
35615630,The Use of Clinical Scores in the Management of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura in Children.,"While the majority of children with recently diagnosed ITP have a benign, self-limiting condition, most often with a spontaneously recovery, 40% of children with ITP progress toward persistent ITP and 10-20% goes toward chronicity. Several clinical scores have been developed with the aim to perform a better monitoring outcome or to differentiate transient vs. persistent ITP (e.g., Donato score). Our paper aims to describe and to compare the most important scores used in the management of ITP in children: bleeding severity scores and chronicity prediction scores. These scores include a combination of different already known risk factors: age, gender, presence of a previous infections or vaccination, bleeding grade, type of onset, platelet count at diagnosis. The real utility of these scores has been a matter of debate and no consensus has been reached so far as to their necessity to be implemented as compulsory tool in the care of children with ITP."
35615072,Complement-Amplifying Conditions in Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome: A Canadian Case Series.,"Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are systemic disorders that often affect the kidneys and encompass a heterogeneous group of conditions, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The complement pathway is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of aHUS, and a favorable response can be obtained through complement C5 inhibition. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the same is also true for several other forms of TMA.
The purpose of this series is to report cases of aHUS in which both an innate defect of the alternative complement pathway and a complement-amplifying condition were suspected.
This case series describes 8 patients who were managed in Canadian tertiary centers for aHUS and who presented initially with complement-amplifying conditions.
In all cases, aHUS was associated with organ dysfunction and in some, with an innate defect of the alternative complement pathway. The complement-amplifying conditions identified were diverse including immune disorders, pregnancy, and a 
These observations illustrate the seriousness of secondary aHUS. They also add to existing lines of evidence that the complement pathway is potentially involved in this condition and that it should be considered as a therapeutic target of interest under such circumstances.
Les microangiopathies thrombotiques (MAT) sont des troubles systémiques qui affectent souvent les reins et qui englobent un groupe hétérogène d’affections, notamment le syndrome hémolytique et urémique atypique (SHUa). On pense que la voie du complément joue un rôle crucial dans la pathogenèse du SHUa et qu’une réponse favorable pourrait être obtenue par inhibition du complément C5. De nouvelles preuves suggèrent qu’il en serait de même pour plusieurs autres formes de MAT.
Cette série vise à rapporter des cas de SHUa pour lesquels on soupçonnait à la fois une anomalie congénitale de la voie alterne du complément et une condition d’amplification du complément.
Cette série décrit les cas de huit patients qui présentaient initialement des conditions d’amplification du complément et qui ont été pris en charge pour un SHUa dans des centres tertiaires canadiens.
Dans tous les cas, le SHUa était associé à un dysfonctionnement d’organe et, dans certains cas, à une anomalie congénitale de la voie alterne du complément. Les conditions d’amplification du complément identifiées étaient diverses, notamment des troubles immunitaires, une grossesse et une infection à une shigatoxine. L’état des patients s’est rapidement amélioré après un traitement avec éculizumab ou des échanges plasmatiques.
Ces observations illustrent la gravité du SHUa secondaire. Elles s’ajoutent aux preuves existantes qui suggèrent que la voie du complément est potentiellement impliquée dans cette pathologie et qu’elle devrait être considérée comme une cible thérapeutique d’intérêt dans de telles circonstances."

35609563,The clinical and laboratory diagnosis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious adverse syndrome occurring 5 to 30 days after adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, a practical evaluation of clinical assessments and laboratory testing for VITT is needed to prevent significant adverse outcomes as the global use of adenoviral vector vaccines continues. We received the clinical information and blood samples of 156 patients in Canada with a suspected diagnosis of VITT between April and July 2021. The performance characteristics of various diagnostic laboratory tests were evaluated against the platelet factor 4 (PF4)-14C-serotonin release assay (SRA) including a commercial anti-PF4/heparin immunoglobulin G (IgG)/IgA/IgM enzyme immunoassay (EIA, PF4 Enhanced; Immucor), in-house IgG-specific anti-PF4 and anti-PF4/heparin-EIAs, the standard SRA, and the PF4/heparin-SRA. Of those, 43 (27.6%) had serologically confirmed VITT-positive based on a positive PF4-SRA result and 113 (72.4%) were VITT-negative. The commercial anti-PF4/heparin EIA, the in-house anti-PF4-EIA, and anti-PF4/heparin-EIA were positive for all 43 VITT-confirmed samples (100% sensitivity) with a few false-positive results (mean specificity, 95.6%). These immunoassays had specificities of 95.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0-98.6), 96.5% (95% CI, 91.2-99.0), and 97.4% (95% CI, 92.4-99.5), respectively. Functional tests, including the standard SRA and PF4/heparin-SRA, had high specificities (100%), but poor sensitivities for VITT (16.7% [95% CI, 7.0-31.4]; and 46.2% [95% CI, 26.6-66.6], respectively). These findings suggest EIA assays that can directly detect antibodies to PF4 or PF4/heparin have excellent performance characteristics and may be useful as a diagnostic test if the F4-SRA is unavailable."
35607248,Safety and effectiveness of nivolumab in Japanese patients with malignant melanoma: Final analysis of a post-marketing surveillance.,"Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody against human programmed death 1, was approved for the treatment of melanoma in July 2014 in Japan. Because the Japanese phase II studies (ONO-4538-02, ONO-4538-08) enrolled small numbers of melanoma patients, post-marketing surveillance (PMS; JapicCTI-163 272) was conducted to collect safety data in a larger patient population. We report data for melanoma patients who received nivolumab between July 4, 2014 and February 28, 2017. Data collected included baseline characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), and overall survival (OS). Of 2069 enrolled patients, 2008 patients were included in the safety analysis population. There were 1030 (51.3%) males, the median age was 69 years, and 269 patients (13.4%) had a performance status of ≥2. The primary tumor sites were cutaneous (34.4%), mucosal (34.2%), acral lentiginous (18.6%), others (6.8%), and unknown (6.3%). TRAE occurred in 62.1% of patients, the most common being hypothyroidism (14.0%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (8.5%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (6.9%). TRAE of special interest in ≥5% of patients were thyroid dysfunction (24.9%), hepatic dysfunction (20.6%), infusion reactions (11.4%), colitis/severe diarrhea (6.3%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD; 5.0%). Several types of TRAE of special interest, which included myasthenia gravis/myocarditis/myositis/rhabdomyolysis (0.9%), venous thromboembolism (0.2%), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (0.1%), and encephalitis (0.0%), were observed in this PMS. Although these TRAE were not reported in previous studies (ONO-4538-02, ONO-4538-08, CheckMate 066, and CheckMate 037), they have been listed in the current Risk Management Plan. History of ILD and male sex were risk factors for ILD in a multivariable analysis. Age <75 years was a risk factor for hepatic dysfunction. At 12 months, median OS was not reached. In conclusion, these results suggested that there was no concern requiring additional precautions for the safety of nivolumab in Japanese patients with melanoma other than the safety information in the Risk Management Plan."
35603866,Eltrombopag improves refractory thrombocytopenia in patients with Sjögren's syndrome.,"Eltrombopag, a kind of thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist, plays the role on the megakaryocyte to activate the platelet production and rapidly increase the number of circulating platelets in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Eltrombopag provides an opportunity for rapid tapering and/or cessation of corticosteroid therapy. However, it is not clear about the platelet response to Eltrombopag in ITP associated with Sjögren's Syndrome(SS).
A retrospective research was conducted on the clinical course of three patients, each with ITP secondary to SS, and initially received therapy of corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory. They took this drug for bleeding diseases. Referring to the description, Eltrombopag was prescribed and adjusted with an initial dose of 25 mg daily, then weekly, then monthly according to the monitoring of platelet counts.
All patients maintained a satisfactory level of platelet counts (>100,000/mm
Eltrombopag is effective and safe for patients with ITP associated with SS during corticosteroid withdrawal. Thus it may be a crucial therapeutic strategy for reducing corticosteroid-related side effects in SS patients with ITP."

The associated clinical and laboratory features have included thrombosis at unusual sites, thrombocytopenia, raised D-dimer levels and positivity for immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies.
A collaborative external quality assessment (EQA) exercise was carried out by distributing five lyophilized samples from subjects with VITT and one from a healthy subject to 500 centers performing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) testing.
Participating centers employed their locally validated testing methods for HIT assays, with some participants additionally reporting results for VITT modified assays.
A total of 385 centers returned results for anti-PF4 immunoassay and functional assays. The ELISA assays used in the detection of anti-PF4 antibodies for the samples distributed had superior sensitivities compared with both the functional assays and the non-ELISA methods.
ELISA-based methods to detect anti PF4 antibodies have a greater sensitivity in confirmation of VITT compared with functional assays regardless of whether such functional assays were modified to be specific for VITT. Rapid immunoassays should not be employed to detect VITT antibodies."

Diagnostic criteria include clinical and laboratory findings. Early treatment is often effective, but rare severe bleeding and death can occur. An autoimmune mechanism is likely.
To determine a role for molecular mimicry in producing disease.
Hexapeptide and heptapeptide matches between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and platelet N-glycosylated proteins and other human proteins were assessed.
Shared viral and platelet glycoprotein peptides were found. Copy frequency of these peptides in the human proteome was low for many of the candidate molecular mimics.
The data support a contribution of molecular mimicry in COVID-19 ITP autoimmunity and offer avenues for in vitro diagnostic assay development. The continuation of the pandemic necessitates additional understanding of COVID-19 ITP as well as studies on diagnosis and mitigation."

Multiple vaccines have been distributed worldwide to control the spread of this pandemic. Several reports of thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia have been described after vaccination. These have been termed vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis (VITT). We report a fatal case of VITT after receiving the first dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. A man in his 30s developed thrombocytopaenia, massive haemoperitoneum due to spleen rupture and extensive portal and femoral vein thrombosis. The patient rapidly developed multiple organ failure and died. We attributed this condition to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship, presence of thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia, high levels of platelet factor 4 antibodies and exclusion of other diagnoses. Healthcare providers should be aware of such rare but fatal complications of COVID-19 immunisation, as early diagnosis of VITT may improve prognosis by allowing timely appropriate treatment."
35589126,Naturally Occurring Anti-Idiotypic Antibodies Portray a Largely Private Repertoire in Immune-Mediated Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.,"Rare immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a life-threatening disease resulting from a severe autoantibody-mediated ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13) deficiency. Acute iTTP episodes are medical emergencies, but when treated appropriately &amp;gt;95% of patients survive. However, at least half of survivors will eventually experience a relapse. How remission of an initial episode is achieved and factors contributing to reemergence of anti-ADAMTS13 Abs and a relapsing course are poorly understood. In acquired hemophilia and systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-idiotypic Abs counteracting and neutralizing pathogenic autoantibodies contribute to remission. We selected and amplified the splenic anti-idiotypic IgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; Fab κ/λ repertoire of two relapsing iTTP patients on previously generated monoclonal inhibitory anti-ADAMTS13 Fabs by phage display to explore whether anti-idiotypic Abs have a role in iTTP. We obtained 27 single anti-idiotypic Fab clones, half of which had unique sequences, although both patients shared four H chain V region genes (V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1-69*01, V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3-15*01, V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3-23*01, and V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3-49*03). Anti-idiotypic Fab pools of both patients fully neutralized the inhibitor capacity of the monoclonal anti-ADAMTS13 Abs used for their selection. Preincubation of plasma samples of 22 unrelated iTTP patients stratified according to functional ADAMTS13 inhibitor titers (&amp;gt;2 Bethesda units/ml, or 1-2 Bethesda units/ml), with anti-idiotypic Fab pools neutralized functional ADAMTS13 inhibitors and restored ADAMTS13 activity in 18-45% of those cases. Taken together, we present evidence for the presence of an anti-idiotypic immune response in iTTP patients. The interindividual generalizability of this response is limited despite relatively uniform pathogenic anti-ADAMTS13 Abs recognizing a dominant epitope in the ADAMTS13 spacer domain."
35586346,The Development of Immune Thrombocytopenia Due to COVID-19 Presenting as Menorrhagia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, is a hematological disorder characterized by a decreased platelet count, predisposing patients to bleeding. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been linked to multiple cases of newly diagnosed ITP and is usually found in moderate-to-severe infections, peaking in children and elderly adults. Menorrhagia is the medical term for menstrual periods with abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding occurring at regular intervals or prolonged uterine bleeding lasting more than seven days. Here, we report the case of a 23-year-old African American female who presented with the chief complaint of menorrhagia and was subsequently diagnosed as having ITP induced by an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection."
35584828,"Thrombocytopenia: the good, the bad and the ugly.","New thrombocytopenia may be associated with a variety of conditions and diagnosis can be challenging. Presentation can vary from life-threatening bleeding or thrombosis to an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. New thrombocytopenia requires urgent investigation. Investigations are mainly guided by findings from the clinical history, physical examination, full blood count and blood film analysis. Aside from the actively bleeding patient, rare but life-threatening causes of thrombocytopenia must be identified early as they require urgent treatment. These include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, suspicion of new acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia. Here, we discuss how to approach a patient with new thrombocytopenia, along with key differentials not to be missed."
35577626,No apparent association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and venous thromboembolism.,"By January 2022 over ten billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered worldwide. Concerns about COVID-19 vaccine-associated thrombosis arose after the characterization of a rare prothrombotic condition associated with adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Although mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to VITT, concerns about thrombosis after vaccination persist despite safety data from hundreds of millions of recipients of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. With widespread vaccination some VTE will occur shortly after vaccination by chance alone because VTE is a common condition that affects 1 to 2 in 1000 persons each year. Detailed analysis is required to determine whether these VTE events are coincidental or associated when they occur in close proximity to mRNA vaccine administration. This paper will review what is currently known about rates of VTE after mRNA vaccination in adults, discuss the reasons why uncertainty on this topic persists, and briefly review the implications of these findings for clinical practice and health policy."
35576367,Cardiovascular and Hematologic Complications of COVID-19 Vaccines.,"COVID-19 is a pro-thrombotic and cardiac-damaging disease. There are four vaccines against COVID-19 currently approved in North America, including the mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, and the adenovirus vector vaccines by Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca. These vaccines have been proven effective in preventing morbidity and mortality in patients who were exposed to COVID-19 infection, but the vaccines have also been associated with complications. Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has a similar pathogenesis to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with an inappropriate immune response leading to platelet activation, consumption of platelets, and thrombosis. It appears to be more common with the adenovirus-vector vaccines. Secondary immune thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported with all COVID-19 vaccines and is distinct from VITT because there is no sign of platelet activation of thrombotic events. Myocarditis and pericarditis are often reported in young males following mRNA vaccines and is often associated with a full recovery. The long-term effects of VITT, secondary immune thrombocytopenic purpura, myocarditis, and pericarditis secondary to COVID-19 vaccines have yet to be elucidated. Continued surveillance for these complications after vaccination is crucial to effectively treat the underlying cause. Patients should consult their physicians regarding repeated vaccine doses after experiencing an adverse effect."
35571527,Pancytopenia with Development of Persistent Neutropenia Secondary to COVID-19.,"Viral infections have long been linked to hematologic dysfunction. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, various hematologic manifestations have emerged. While there have been several reports of immune thrombocytopenic purpura from SARS-CoV-2, concurrent lymphopenia and anemia have sparse. We describe a case of COVID-induced pancytopenia that presented months after initial COVID infection that initially responded to IVIG and steroids, but now with persistent neutropenia."
35567301,Sarcoidosis-Associated Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.,"Sarcoidosis is well known for heterogeneity of its presentation and multisystem organ involvement. It commonly involves respiratory tract, skin, eyes, and lymph nodes, as well as hematologic and renal systems. While anemia and lymphopenia are the most common hematologic abnormalities seen in sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is considered rare. Renal abnormalities, although infrequent, are usually more likely to involve tubules rather than glomeruli. In this report, we present a case of sarcoidosis-associated ITP and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), refractory to first-line therapy, but successfully treated with Rituximab and thrombopoietin-receptor agonist."
35562809,Gaucher disease carrier with gestational thrombocytopenia and anemia: a case report.,"Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that causes disorders of blood, bone, and central nervous system as well as hepatosplenomegaly. We present the case of a carrier of Gaucher disease with gestational thrombocytopenia and anemia that required blood transfusion therapy.
A 24-year-old Nepalese primipara was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia at 12 weeks of gestation. Her platelet count had reduced to 30,000/µL at 21 weeks of gestation, and the hemoglobin content reduced to 7.6 g/dL at 27 weeks of gestation. As she did not respond to any medication, blood transfusion was performed. A female infant weighing 2677 g was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks of gestation. On the 78th day of puerperium, the platelet count of the mother recovered to 101,000/µL, and the hemoglobin content recovered to 12.5 g/dL. The infant had convulsions, respiratory depression, wheezing, systemic purpura, and exfoliation of the epidermis at birth. The infant was diagnosed with Gaucher disease at 37 days of age and passed away at 82 days of age. Subsequently, the parents were diagnosed as carriers of Gaucher disease.
As carriers of this disease do not usually show symptoms, it is imperative to provide information regarding disease management for future pregnancies."
35561312,"GPVI expression is linked to platelet size, age, and reactivity.","Platelets within one individual display heterogeneity in reactivity, size, age, and expression of surface receptors. To investigate the combined intraindividual contribution of platelet size, platelet age, and receptor expression levels on the reactivity of platelets, we studied fractions of large and small platelets from healthy donors separated by using differential centrifugation. Size-separated platelet fractions were perfused over a collagen-coated surface to assess thrombus formation. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to characterize resting and stimulated platelet subpopulations, and platelet age was determined based on RNA and HLA-I labeling. Signal transduction was analyzed by measuring consecutive phosphorylation of serine/threonine-protein kinase Akt. Compared with small platelets, large platelets adhered faster to collagen under flow and formed larger thrombi. Among the large platelets, a highly reactive juvenile platelet subpopulation was identified with high glycoprotein VI (GPVI) expression. Elevated GPVI expression correlated with high HLA-I expression, RNA content, and increased platelet reactivity. There was a stronger difference in Akt phosphorylation and activation upon collagen stimulation between juvenile and older platelets than between large and small platelets. GPVI expression and platelet reactivity decreased throughout platelet storage at 22°C and was better maintained throughout cold storage at 4°C. We further detected higher GPVI expression in platelets of patients with immune thrombocytopenia. Our findings show that high GPVI expression is a feature of highly reactive juvenile platelets, which are predominantly found among the large platelet population, explaining the better performance of large platelets during thrombus formation. These data are important for studies of thrombus formation, platelet storage, and immune thrombocytopenia."

35560046,Monoclonal and oligoclonal anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies mediate VITT.,"Kanack and colleagues analyze anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies from 5 patients with vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) secondary to COVID-19 adenoviral vaccination and antibodies from patients with spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and classical HIT. VITT antibodies are monoclonal or oligoclonal, similar to spontaneous HIT, whereas classical HIT antibodies are polyclonal. Heparin inhibits antibody-induced platelet activation in VITT, suggesting that heparin should be considered for the treatment of VITT."
35549802,"Safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide for injection in Chinese healthy volunteers: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.","The thrombopoietin mimetic peptide for injection is a second-generation thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) used in the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenia. The aim of the present study was to assess the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide for injection in Chinese healthy volunteers. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study was conducted in healthy Chinese subjects aged 18-50 years. Thirty subjects received single subcutaneous injection of 0.3 μg/kg, 1.0 μg/kg, 2.0 μg/kg thrombopoietin mimetic peptide or placebo. Thrombopoietin mimetic peptide was safe and well tolerated at doses of 0.3-2.0 μg/kg. There was no significant change in mean platelet count (PLT) from baseline at the 0.3 μg/kg or placebo groups. The mean PLT of subjects in the 1.0 μg/kg and 2.0 μg/kg groups peaked at day 12 (± 1), began to decline around day 17, and returned to the baseline level at day 28 (± 1). Platelet aggregation rates of the three dose groups showed no significant change before and after administration. Serum concentrations of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide in all subjects were below the quantization limit. This was the first study to demonstrate that subcutaneous injection of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide at doses of 0.3-2.0 μg/kg was safe and well tolerated in Chinese healthy subjects. As a second-generation TPO-RA, thrombopoietin mimetic peptide is effective at improving PLT after single subcutaneous injection at dose of ≥1 μg/kg."
35546175,Seroconversion to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with autoimmune cytopenias and bone marrow failures.,"Data concerning the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with non-oncological hematologic conditions are lacking. These include autoimmune cytopenias (autoimmune hemolytic anemia AIHA, immune thrombocytopenia ITP, and autoimmune neutropenia), and bone marrow failure syndromes (aplastic anemia, low risk myelodysplastic syndromes, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). These conditions may relapse/reactivate after COVID-19 infection and vaccine. Moreover, they are mainly handled with immunosuppressive drugs that may hamper the response to vaccine. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the rate of seroconversion after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with autoimmune cytopenias or bone marrow failure syndrome after 2 ± 1 months from the last vaccine dose. Overall, 149 patients were tested and 135 (91%) seroconverted. The highest proportion of non-responders was observed in Evans syndrome (association of ITP and AIHA) and warm AIHA patients (p = 0.001), in those with lower levels of baseline serum IgG (p = 0.008), and in patients on active therapy with steroids (p = 0.03) who also had lower anti-Spike titers. The latter were inversely related with age, and a positively with lymphocyte counts. Additionally, patients who had received rituximab within 12 months from vaccination showed higher rates of non-response (p = 0.03) as compared to those treated before. Contrarily, cyclosporine alone, complement inhibitors, and bone marrow stimulating agents had no detrimental effect on seroconversion. These data suggest maintaining high vigilance and adherence to preventive/protective measures in this population since a proportion of cases may not respond or exhibit low anti-Spike titers."

35538613,Mimic or coincidentally? TAFRO syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus: A case-based review.,"Castleman's disease (CD) is a rare, systemic disease with histopathological features of angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia. In the literature, there are case-level reports that mimic or coexist with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) clinically and in the laboratory. Is this condition two separate diseases or is it an imitation of each other? A 73-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with arthritis, lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and malar rash. He had a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombosis in the right leg tibialis posterior and dorsalis pedis arteries. Excisional lymphadenopathy biopsy indicated a diagnosis of hyaline-vascular-type CD. She had anti-nuclear antibody >1/80 homogeneous pattern, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), Anti-Smith (Sm) antibody positivity, hypocomplementemia (C3 and C4), pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. For this reason, the classification criteria of the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology were studied. Clinical findings, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura history, antibody positivity, malar rash, and arthritis led us to the diagnosis of SLE. She was treated with 1 mg/kg/day prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg 2 × 1. Azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg daily was added to the patient whose complaints did not improve. In the follow-ups, she completely recovered clinically and laboratory. SLE and CD are systemic diseases that overlap in many ways. The literature review shows that these two diseases may mimic each other or may coexist. This situation may be a reflection of a pathophysiological process that has not yet been clarified. This confusing process also affects the treatment decision. This confusing process also affects the treatment decision."
35536600,The Extensive Regulation of MicroRNA in Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is a small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecule that plays a variety of key roles in different biological processes through post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. MiRNA has been proved to be a variety of cellular processes involved in development, differentiation, signal transduction, and is an important regulator of immune and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it may act as potent modulators of the immune system and play an important role in the development of several autoimmune diseases. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune systemic disease characterized by a low platelet count. Several studies suggest that like other autoimmune disorders, miRNAs are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of ITP, interacting with the function of innate and adaptive immune responses. In this review, we discuss emerging knowledge about the function of miRNAs in ITP and describe miRNAs in terms of their role in the immune system and autoimmune response. These findings suggest that miRNA may be a useful therapeutic target for ITP by regulating the immune system. In the future, we need to have a more comprehensive understanding of miRNAs and how they regulate the immune system of patients with ITP."
35536172,Exacerbation of immune thrombocytopenia following initial and booster vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.,"As the immune thrombocytopenia exacerbation rate after booster COVID-19 vaccines is unknown, we explore the rates after first, second and booster Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. A retrospective study of adult ITP patients, receiving 1-3 vaccines was performed. The primary outcome was clinical ITP exacerbation defined as platelet count decrease requiring initiation/escalation of ITP treatment and/or new medical attention due to bleeding, within 3 months. Secondary outcome was any clinically relevant platelet decrease during the 3 months post-vaccination. The study included 93 ITP patients receiving 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 22) or 3 (n = 69) vaccines. ITP exacerbation occurred in 2/93 (2.2%) patients following initial vaccination and in 3/69 (4.3%) following booster dose. Clinically relevant platelet decreases after initial doses occurred in 8/72 (11.1%) patients and in 8/39 (20.5%) after the booster. Clinical ITP exacerbation after booster doses did not follow clinical exacerbation after initial doses. Half of patients with clinically relevant platelet decreases after booster dose also had clinically relevant decreases following initial vaccination. We concluded that clinical ITP exacerbation is infrequent following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical exacerbation after booster doses was not preceded by clinical exacerbation after initial doses. Clinically relevant platelet decreases after booster doses occur frequently in patients with clinically relevant decreases after initial doses."
35535430,Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia in a male after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination presenting as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare and life-threatening complication that can occur after COVID-19 vaccination. After the first reports of VITT and CVST in 2021 after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination, the FDA and CDC recommended an emergency pause on 13 April 2021, and after extensive safety reviews, on 23 April 2021, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reaffirmed its original recommendation for use of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. As of 31 August 2021, in the United States, 54 cases of VITT following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination (37 female, 17 male) have been reported out of 14.1 million total shots given, 29 of which had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). With more data, on 16 December 2021, the CDC endorsed the ACIP recommendations for individuals to receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in preference over the Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. We report a rare case of a male with confirmed VITT and CVST following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination."
35533526,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) after COVID-19 vaccination: A systematic review of reported cases.,"With the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, hospitalization rates and progression to severe COVID-19 disease have reduced drastically. Most of the adverse events reported by the vaccine recipients were minor. However, autoimmune hematological complications such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and TTP have also been reported post-COVID-19 vaccination. Given this, we sought to reflect on the existing cases of TTP, whether de novo or relapsing, reported after COVID-19 vaccination to further gain insight into any association, if present, and outcomes.
We searched PubMed, Embase, and Ebsco databases for published individual case reports on the occurrence or relapse of TTP after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 23 articles (27 patients) were included in this qualitative analysis.
The mean age for the patients who developed de novo TTP post-COVID-19 vaccination was 51.3 years. TTP episodes were seen mostly after BNT162b2 vaccine, followed by mRNA-1273 vaccine. All patients with immune TTP except one received plasma exchange (PLEX) and steroids. One patient passed away after two days of hospitalization, likely due to a sudden cardiovascular event.
Our review underscores the importance of in-depth anamnesis before vaccination and outlines characteristics of predisposed individuals. Evaluation of post-vaccine thrombocytopenia must include the possibility of TTP given the associated fatality with this condition."
35532821,Potential risk factors for the development from immune thrombocytopenia to systemic lupus erythematosus: a case-control study in Chinese children.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients are at risk developing to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the future. Our study attempted to explore the potential risk factors for the development from ITP to SLE in Chinese children by statistical analysis. This study was a retrospective case-control study. Patients diagnosed with ITP and developed to SLE after the diagnosis of ITP were defined as the case group. The control group consisted of children with ITP but without developing to SLE was recruited with a ratio of 1:2. Besides univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression was built to evaluate the potential risk factors. A total of 150 children was included with 50 in the case group and 100 in the control group. Median developing time from ITP to SLE was 34.5 [IQR 12.5, 58.75] months. ANA was found significantly different between the two groups in our study in the univariable analysis but not in the multivariable analysis (OR = 4.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 21.01). Age diagnosed ITP was positively associated with SLE (OR = 1.07 every 5 years, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.15) with alert point at 8 years old (sensitivity 0.82, specificity 0.60). A lower level of complement was also positively associated with SLE (OR = 8.33, 95% CI 1.62 to 42.91). A minimum 3-year of close follow-up for pediatric ITP patients was recommended to monitor the risk for developing SLE. Older age and hypocomplementemia were potential risk factors for the development from ITP to SLE."
35531637,Investigational drugs for immune thrombocytopenia.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease of unknown cause. Autoantibodies, self-reactive T cells and other immune abnormalities, with impairment of platelet production, lead to a reduced platelet count. Until recently, therapy was largely empirical using immune suppressants (none of which have undergone randomized clinical trials). These therapies have variable efficacy and are associated with predictable unwanted effects which impact patient quality-of-life. With greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, better, more targeted therapies have been developed; however, there is still an urgent need for additional classes of treatment.
This article covers new TPO receptor agonists, Syk inhibitors, Fcγ receptor antagonists, BTK and complement inhibitors, and other therapies. Insights into the most promising therapies are offered. Novel ITP treatments currently in clinical trials and those recently approved come under the spotlight.
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists remain the most effective treatment for ITP and have changed the ITP therapeutic landscape remarkably. Other new molecules such as Fcγ receptor blockers, Bruton tyrosine kinase, complement inhibitors, and others are unlikely to enjoy the same success rate as the TPO-RAs, but nonetheless they will find a place in the management of patients with ITP."
35530917,A Rare Case of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Manifesting as Genital Ulcers.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting multiple organ systems. In this report, we discuss the case of a patient with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hypothyroidism, SLE, and Crohn's disease (CD) who presented to the emergency room with fever, burning micturition, abdominal pain, and perineal ulcers. Upon subsequent treatment for urinary tract infections (UTI) and negative evaluations for an infectious cause of genital ulcers like sexually transmitted diseases, the etiology of ulcers was found to be SLE. This case report highlights the importance of including SLE ulcers in the differential diagnosis when an SLE patient presents with genital ulcers and the importance of ruling out an SLE vs. infection or non-infection as the cause of ulcers in a former SLE patient."

35528763,Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura as an Extraintestinal Manifestation in a Patient with Ulcerative Colitis.,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against platelet membrane antigens, leading to immune-mediated platelet destruction. ITP is considered as a rare extraintestinal manifestation (EIM) of ulcerative colitis (UC). This report aimed to describe a rare case of UC associated with ITP and a review of the literature. A 49-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with severe acute colitis which was responsive to treatment (hydrocortisone 300 mg/day). The patient was discharged from the hospital with prednisone 60 mg/day and azathioprine 50 mg/day. During the follow-up, the dose of azathioprine was increased to 100 mg/day (1.3 mg/kg), while prednisone tapering was started. After 3 months, the patient presented with thrombocytopenia (30,000 platelets/µL) without improvement despite receiving the suspension of azathioprine; thus, a bone marrow aspirate was performed. The bone marrow analysis showed hyperplasia of the erythroid series, megaloblastosis, hyperplasia of megakaryocytes with mild dyspoiesis, and absence of cytotoxicity, a morphological finding consistent with ITP. The patient was treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day which resulted in partial improvement of the condition and his still being followed up as outpatient using mesalazine 3.2 g for UC and a platelet count of approximately 50,000/µL using eltrombopag. As reported, ITP is a rare EIM in patients with UC. Due to the risk of complications, such as bleeding, hematological changes in these patients should be considered. The disease should be suspected in the presence of thrombocytopenia, always excluding the side effects of medications in advance, especially immunosuppressants. The correct diagnosis of this rare manifestation and proper treatment are essential to control the condition, prevent complications, and improve the patient's prognosis."

A higher expression level of miR-106b-5p and Th17/Treg imbalance may be observed in children with ITP. The measurement of miR-106b-5p, Th17, Treg, and Th17/Treg ratio during treatment may be useful to the evaluation of treatment outcome in children with ITP."
35527057,"Background incidence rates of adverse events of special interest related to COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario, Canada, 2015 to 2020, to inform COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance.","Background incidence rates are critical in pharmacovigilance to facilitate identification of vaccine safety signals. We estimated background incidence rates of 11 adverse events of special interest related to COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario, Canada.
We conducted a population-based retrospective observational study using linked health administrative databases for hospitalizations and emergency department visits among Ontario residents. We estimated incidence rates of Bell's palsy, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, febrile convulsions, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, Kawasaki disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, acute myocardial infarction, and anaphylaxis during five pre-pandemic years (2015-2019) and 2020.
The average annual population was 14 million across all age groups with 51% female. The pre-pandemic mean annual rates per 100,000 population during 2015-2019 were 191 for acute myocardial infarction, 43.9 for idiopathic thrombocytopenia, 28.8 for anaphylaxis, 27.8 for Bell's palsy, 25.0 for febrile convulsions, 22.8 for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, 11.3 for myocarditis/pericarditis, 8.7 for pericarditis, 2.9 for myocarditis, 2.0 for Kawasaki disease, 1.9 for Guillain-Barré syndrome, and 1.7 for transverse myelitis. Females had higher rates of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis and anaphylaxis while males had higher rates of myocarditis, pericarditis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Bell's palsy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome increased with age. The mean rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis increased with age up to 79 years; males had higher rates than females: from 12 to 59 years for myocarditis and ≥12 years for pericarditis. Febrile convulsions and Kawasaki disease were predominantly childhood diseases and generally decreased with age.
Our estimated background rates will permit estimating numbers of expected events for these conditions and facilitate detection of potential safety signals following COVID-19 vaccination."

The acquired TTP is further classified as idiopathic and secondary TTP. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is regarded as one of the most common causes of secondary TTP (SLE-TTP). In contrast to patients with idiopathic TTP, some patients with SLE-TTP, especially those diagnosed with refractory TTP, are resistant to plasma exchange and high-dose corticosteroids and usually require second-line drugs, including newly developed biologicals. Belimumab, a B-lymphocyte stimulator-specific inhibitor, was the first approved new therapy for SLE in the past 50 years. Only two cases of SLE-TTP using belimumab have been reported; however, detailed information has not been made available. Herein, we describe a 28-year-old female patient who presented with palm petechiae, strong tawny urine, and yellow stained skin and sclera, and was diagnosed with SLE-TTP supported by high anti-ANA titers; positive anti-SSA/SM; pleural effusion; decreased platelet count, hemoglobin, and complement C3/C4 counts; increased lactate dehydrogenase level, along with increased schistocytes; and a significant deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity. Belimumab (10 mg/kg) was administered after six plasma exchanges. Good efficiency and outcomes without any adverse events, SLE, or TTP relapse were observed during 12 months of follow-up. Therefore, belimumab is a promising choice for SLE-TTP management. In addition, we provide a focused review of the existing literature on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies for SLE-TTP."

An acute diagnostic picture of splenosis of the left epigastric region and chronic non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation was found 20 years later.
35520365,Fuchs Syndrome with Isolated Oral Mucosa Lesions due to Severe Herpes Simplex Cheilitis in a Patient with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe dermatological disease classically characterized by erythematous target lesions and mucosal involvement. Fuchs syndrome is an incomplete presentation of SJS which has oral, conjunctival and genital manifestations but no skin lesions. To the best of our knowledge, our case of Fuchs syndrome in an 80-year-old man is the first such case related to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection to be described. Our patient quickly recovered following IVIG therapy, although specific treatment is still a topic of discussion. Research is required on this poorly understood dermatological disease to determine optimum therapy.
We report a case of Fuchs syndrome in an elderly man after HSV-1 cheilitis.Therapy always includes discontinuation of the causative drug.Specific therapy for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Fuchs syndrome is still a topic of discussion, although we noted marked improvement following the administration of IVIG therapy."
35514990,Case Report: Thrombotic-Thrombocytopenic Purpura Following Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Combination Immunotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma.,"A man in his early 50s presented with small bowel obstruction, requiring emergency laparoscopic small bowel resection for the metastatic melanoma of the jejunum with no identifiable primary lesion. One week after his first treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he presented with diffuse abdominal pain, constipation, and fatigue. A computerized tomography scan did not identify a cause for his symptoms. This was rapidly followed by thrombocytopenia on day 11 and then anemia. He commenced intravenous corticosteroids for a suspected diagnosis of immune-related thrombocytopenia. On day 15, a generalized onset motor seizure occurred, and despite plasmapheresis later that day, the patient died from fatal immune-related thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This was confirmed with suppressed ADAMTS13 (<5%) testing on day 14. Immune-related TTP is a rare and, in this case, fatal immune- related adverse event. Further studies are required to identify additional immunosuppressive management for immune-related TTP."
35514985,Case Report: Use of Obinutuzumab as an Alternative Monoclonal Anti-CD20 Antibody in a Patient With Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenia Complicated by Rituximab-Induced Serum Sickness and Anti-Rituximab Antibodies.,"Management of refractory immune thrombocytopenia frequently involves rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to target B cells and induce remission in most patients. However, neutralizing antibodies to rituximab that nullify therapeutic response and may lead to serum sickness have been rarely reported. Here, we present a case of a young adult woman with Evans syndrome treated with rituximab, complicated by the development of serum sickness, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and platelet refractoriness presumed secondary to neutralizing antibodies to rituximab. She was successfully treated with the humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, with subsequent symptom resolution. Additionally, a review of 10 previously published cases of serum-sickness associated with the use of rituximab for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is summarized. This case highlights that recognition of more subtle or rare symptoms of rituximab-induced serum sickness is important to facilitate rapid intervention."
35512907,Pathogenesis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT; synonym, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, is associated with high-titer immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies activate platelets via platelet FcγIIa receptors, with platelet activation greatly enhanced by PF4. Here we summarize the current concepts in the pathogenesis of VITT. We first address parallels between heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and VITT, and provide recent findings on binding of PF4 to adenovirus particles and non-assembled adenovirus proteins in the 2 adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S. Further, we discuss the potential role of vaccine constituents such as glycosaminoglycans, EDTA, polysorbate 80, human cell-line proteins and nucleotides as potential binding partners of PF4. The immune response towards PF4 in VITT is likely triggered by a proinflammatory milieu. Human cell-line proteins, non-assembled virus proteins, and potentially EDTA may contribute to the proinflammatory state. The transient nature of the immune response towards PF4 in VITT makes it likely that-as in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia -marginal zone B cells are key for antibody production. Once high-titer anti-PF4 antibodies have been formed 5 to 20 days after vaccination, they activate platelets and granulocytes. Activated granulocytes undergo NETosis and the released DNA also forms complexes with PF4, which fuels the Fcγ receptor-dependent cell activation process, ultimately leading to massive thrombin generation. Finally, we summarize our initial observations indicating that VITT-like antibodies might also be present in rare patients with recurrent venous and arterial thrombotic complications, independent of vaccination."
35512906,Treatment of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a novel prothrombotic disorder characterized by thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation identified in hundreds of recipients of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), an adenovirus vector coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. VITT resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in that patients have platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies; however, whereas heparin typically enhances platelet activation by HIT antibodies, VITT antibody-induced platelet activation is often inhibited in vitro by pharmacological concentrations of heparin. Further, the thrombotic complications in VITT feature much higher frequencies of atypical thrombosis, most notably cerebral vein thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis, compared with HIT. In this review, we outline the treatments that have been used to manage this novel condition since its recognition in March 2021, including anticoagulation, high-dose intravenous immune globulin, therapeutic plasma exchange, corticosteroids, rituximab, and eculizumab. We discuss the controversial issue of whether heparin, which often inhibits VITT antibody-induced platelet activation, is harmful in the treatment of VITT. We also describe a case of ""long VITT,"" describing the treatment challenges resulting from platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies that persisted for more than 9 months."
35512905,Laboratory testing for VITT antibodies.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a highly prothrombotic disorder that like heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is caused by platelet-activating antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4). However, unlike HIT-where heparin at low concentrations (0.1-0.5 U/mL) typically enhances antibody-induced platelet activation, platelet activation by VITT sera is usually inhibited by heparin. Further, conventional platelet activation assays for HIT, such as the serotonin-release assay (SRA) and heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) test, often yield negative or atypical results when testing VITT sera. Nevertheless, VITT (like HIT) is a ""clinical-pathological"" disorder whereby laboratory detectability of platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies is crucial for diagnosis. VITT antibodies follow 2 fundamental principles of HIT laboratory testing: (1) high probability of a positive PF4-dependent enzyme-immunoassay (EIA), and (2) high probability of a positive platelet activation assay. However, optimal detection of VITT in platelet activation assays requires the addition of PF4, for example, PF4-enhanced SRA (PF4-SRA) and PF4-enhanced HIPA (PIPA). A novel whole blood assay, called the PF4-induced flow cytometry-based platelet activation (PIFPA) assay, exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for VITT. HIT and VITT sera/plasmas differ in their reactivity in rapid HIT immunoassays (90-97% sensitivity for HIT, <25% sensitivity for VITT), consistent with distinct antigen sites on PF4 recognized by HIT and VITT antibodies."
35512904,Clinical picture of VITT.,"This chapter explores the clinical features of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, also called vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT). Whilst the etiology is distinct from other causes of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), presentation may be similar and hence the need for strict diagnostic criteria to ensure accurate and prompt diagnosis and early treatment. Studies have identified prognostic markers of the disease, directing therapy and management pathways, and mortality and morbidity from this rare but life-threatening and potentially disabling consequence of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine has declined."
35512903,Epidemiology of VITT.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a life-threatening syndrome of aggressive thrombosis, often profound thrombocytopenia, and frequently overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. It has been associated with 2 adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). Unlike the myriad of other conditions that cause thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, VITT has an important distinguishing feature: affected individuals have platelet activating anti-PF4 antibodies that appear in a predictable time frame following vaccination. The reported incidence of VITT differs between jurisdictions; it is dependent on accurate ascertainment of cases and accurate estimates of the size of the vaccinated population. The incidence ranges from 1 case per 26,500 to 127,3000 first doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administered. It is estimated at 1 case per 518,181 second doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administered, and 1 case per 263,000 Ad26.COV2.S doses administered. There are no clear risk factors for VITT, including sex, age, or comorbidities. VITT is a rare event, but its considerable morbidity and mortality merit ongoing pharmacovigilance, and accurate case ascertainment."
35512902,Platelet-activating anti-PF4 disorders: An overview.,"Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a highly cationic tetrameric protein that can be targeted by platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class. Certain features of PF4, including its multivalent nature (duplicate antigen sites per tetramer), the ability of many PF4 tetramers to undergo close approximation through charge neutralization, and the dimeric binding of IgG molecules, results in formation of IgG-containing immune complexes in situ on platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes, resulting in Fcγ receptor-mediated pancellular activation that also activates hemostasis (potential for disseminated intravascular coagulation). This review discusses 4 anti-PF4 disorders: classic heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ([HIT]; triggered by heparin and certain other polyanionic pharmaceuticals, featuring predominantly heparin-dependent antibodies), autoimmune HIT (aHIT; severe subtype of HIT that features both heparin-dependent and heparin-independent platelet-activating antibodies), and spontaneous HIT (non-heparin triggers such as knee replacement surgery and infection; predominantly heparin-independent platelet-activating antibodies). Most recently, a novel fourth anti-PF4 disorder, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), was identified as an ultrarare complication of adenovirus vector vaccines. VITT is characterized by thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, a high frequency of thrombosis-including in unusual sites (cerebral veins, splanchnic veins)-and highly pathogenic anti-PF4 antibodies with heparin-independent platelet-activating properties."

35512900,The psychiatric and psychological sequelae of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).,"This review paper explores the potential psychiatric and psychological sequelae of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, also called vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis (VITT). In the absence of any literature to date we have extrapolated data from similar conditions, particularly data pertaining to the critical care population. We discuss both the direct and indirect effects of thrombosis, likely psychiatric and psychological challenges during recovery, and ethical issues around vaccination. We have also suggested a comprehensive guide to the psychiatric assessment and management of patients presenting with VITT with the aim of early identification of problems and maximizing rehabilitation potential and quality of life."
35512899,Longitudinal Aspects of VITT.,"In hundreds of patients worldwide, vaccination against COVID-19 with adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; Ad26.COV2.S) triggered platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies inducing vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). In most VITT patients, platelet-activating anti-PF4-antibodies are transient and the disorder is discrete and non-recurring. However, in some patients platelet-activating antibodies persist, associated with recurrent thrombocytopenia and sometimes with relapse of thrombosis despite therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Anti-PF4 IgG antibodies measured by enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) are usually detectable for longer than platelet-activating antibodies in functional assays, but duration of detectability is highly assay-dependent. As more than 1 vaccination dose against COVID-19 is required to achieve sufficient protection, at least 69 VITT patients have undergone subsequent vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, with no relevant subsequent increase in anti-PF4 antibody titers, thrombocytopenia, or thrombotic complications. Also, re-exposure to adenoviral vector-based vaccines in 5 VITT patients was not associated with adverse reactions. Although data are limited, vaccination against influenza also appears to be safe. SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in 1 patient with preceding VITT did not influence anti-PF4 antibody levels. We discuss how these temporal characteristics of VITT provide insights into pathogenesis."
35511612,Relapse of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination: a prospective cohort study.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare and life-threatening disease. Vaccination has been reported to be a trigger of onset and relapse of autoimmune diseases. We evaluated after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination 32 adult patients previously diagnosed with iTTP by means of weekly monitoring of complete blood count and ADAMTS13 testing. Thirty of 32 patients received at least one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, the remaining two received Moderna. A total of five patients, all vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech, had a biochemical relapse at a median post-vaccination time of 15 days following the second or third vaccine dose, presenting without measurable ADAMTS13 activity and a median anti- ADAMTS13 autoantibody value of 34 U/mL. Four of five cases had concomitant clinical relapse and were treated with corticosteroids alone or daily sessions of plasma exchange and caplacizumab, while one patient was closely monitored with ADAMTS13 with no onset of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Although the benefits of vaccination exceed its potential risks, clinicians should be aware that iTTP relapse might follow COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, laboratory and clinical monitoring of iTTP patients should be done in the first post-vaccination month, in order to promptly diagnose and treat any relapse."
35510743,Refractory immune TTP following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine successfully salvaged with caplacizumab.,"Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy caused by antibodies against ADAMTS13. We report a young, healthy female who developed hematuria, vomiting, and hematemesis 3 weeks after her first dose of Pfizer Bio-NTech COVID-19 vaccine. Investigations confirmed iTTP with undetectable ADAMTS13 activity and a positive antibody assay. Despite initial response to standard treatment with plasma exchange and corticosteroids, she had an acute deterioration of her TTP with neurological and cardiac involvement. Fortunately, she then had prompt response to rituximab and emergently obtained caplacizumab and is now in remission. Although most cases of iTTP are of unknown etiology, we cannot exclude that her almost fatal iTTP episode was triggered by the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This case also highlights the ability of caplacizumab to quickly halt disseminated thrombus formation in refractory TTP."
35507753,Alterations in B- and circulating T-follicular helper cell subsets in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells regulate development of antigen-specific B-cell immunity. We prospectively investigated B-cell and circulating Tfh (cTfh) cell subsets in 45 patients with immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) at presentation and longitudinally after rituximab (RTX). B-cell phenotype was altered at acute iTTP presentation with decreased transitional cells and post-germinal center (post-GC) memory B cells and increased plasmablasts compared with healthy controls. A higher percentage of plasmablasts was associated with higher anti-ADAMTS13 IgG and lower ADAMTS13 antigen levels. In asymptomatic patients with ADAMTS13 relapse, there were increased naïve B cells and a global decrease in memory subsets, with a trend to increased plasmablasts. Total circulating Tfh (CD4+CXCR5+) and PD1+ Tfh cells were decreased at iTTP presentation. CD80 expression was decreased on IgD+ memory cells and double-negative memory cells in acute iTTP. At repopulation after B-cell depletion in de novo iTTP, post-GC and double-negative memory B cells were reduced compared with pre-RTX. RTX did not cause alteration in cTfh cell frequency. The subsequent kinetics of naïve, transitional, memory B cells and plasmablasts did not differ significantly between patients who went on to relapse vs those who remained in remission. In summary, acute iTTP is characterized by dysregulation of B- and cTfh cell homeostasis with depletion of post-GC memory cells and cTfh cells and increased plasmablasts. Changes in CD80 expression on B cells further suggest altered interactions with T cells."
35505368,"Severe immune thrombocytopenia following diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio vaccination in a 36-year-old Caucasian woman: a case report.","Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet counts and increased bleeding risk. The disease may be induced by other disorders, including malignancies, autoimmune diseases, infectious agents or drugs. However, ITP has also been described following vaccinations, such as the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. In rare cases, ITP may occur in children who received a DTaP-IP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine and inactivated poliovirus) vaccine. Hereinafter, we report the first well-documented cases of ITP in an adult patient in the temporal context of a DTaP-IP vaccination.
This case report attempts to capture the life-threatening picture of a 36-year-old otherwise healthy Caucasian woman with newly diagnosed severe immune thrombocytopenia in the temporal context of a DTaP-IP vaccination. Four days after receiving the vaccine, the women presented to her primary care physician with malaise, fever and recurrent epistaxis. Clinical examination revealed oral petechiae, ecchymoses, and non-palpable petechiae on both legs. The patient was immediately referred to a local hematology unit where she developed hematuria and an intestinal bleeding (WHO Bleeding Grade III) requiring multiple transfusions. After receiving oral corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins, her platelets gradually recovered. Common causes of secondary ITP were ruled out by laboratory investigations, bone marrow and peripheral blood examinations. This raises the possibility of a (secondary) vaccination-associated thrombocytopenia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of a DTaP-IP vaccination-related ITP in an adult patient in the English literature.
Although a causal connection between both entities may not be established, we would like to raise awareness in clinicians that ITP following DTaP-IP vaccinations is potentially not limited to children, but may also occur in adults. Users of DTaP-IP booster vaccines should be alert of the possibility of such adverse reactions."
35503254,High-affinity autoreactive plasma cells disseminate through multiple organs in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.,"The major therapeutic goal for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is to restore normal platelet counts using drugs to promote platelet production or by interfering with mechanisms responsible for platelet destruction. Eighty percent of patients with ITP possess anti-integrin αIIbβ3 IgG autoantibodies that cause platelet opsonization and phagocytosis. The spleen is considered the primary site of autoantibody production by autoreactive B cells and platelet destruction. The immediate failure in approximately 50% of patients to recover a normal platelet count after anti-CD20 rituximab-mediated B cell depletion and splenectomy suggests that autoreactive, rituximab-resistant, IgG-secreting B cells (IgG-SCs) reside in other anatomical compartments. We analyzed more than 3,300 single IgG-SCs from spleen, bone marrow, and/or blood of 27 patients with ITP, revealing high interindividual variability in affinity for αIIbβ3, with variations over 3 logs. IgG-SC dissemination and range of affinities were, however, similar for each patient. Longitudinal analysis of autoreactive IgG-SCs upon treatment with the anti-CD38 mAb daratumumab demonstrated variable outcomes, from complete remission to failure with persistence of high-affinity anti-αIIbβ3 IgG-SCs in the bone marrow. This study demonstrates the existence and dissemination of high-affinity autoreactive plasma cells in multiple anatomical compartments of patients with ITP that may cause the failure of current therapies."
35494991,Mitomycin-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Treated Successfully With Plasmapheresis and Steroid: A Case Report.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) caused by severely reduced ADAMTS13 or the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (VWFCP) enzyme resulting in low platelet and red blood cell counts along with severe renal, cardiac, and neurological dysfunction. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice. Mitomycin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers anal and breast cancers, has been reported to occasionally cause severe TTP and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) cases. Here, we present a case of a 57-year-old African American transgender patient who presented with worsening kidney function, thrombocytopenia, and anemia following mitomycin therapy for her anal squamous cell carcinoma. Peripheral smear showed numerous schistocytes, and the patient was diagnosed with TTP because of low ADAMTS13 levels. The patient was started on plasmapheresis and steroid with ultimate improvement in condition. TTP is a rare condition that can be idiopathic or acquired. Further research is required to assess the complexity of the underlying mechanism. Early diagnosis and aggressive management often lead to a favorable outcome."
35491467,Tapering of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist in paediatric patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia: Is it possible?,"It is not clear if platelet responses are sustained after thrombopoietin receptor agonist (ar-TPO) withdrawal in paediatric patients. A multicentre retrospective observational study was performed in children with chronic immune thrombopenia (cITP) to describe ar-TPO tapering and withdrawal in patients who had achieved a sustained complete response to ar-TPOs. Ten patients (eltrombopag n = 6, romiplostim n = 4) were included. Treatment withdrawal was performed after a mean tapering time of 7.6 months. Two patients relapsed (median follow-up time of 24 months). Slow tapering and withdrawal of ar-TPOs can be safely performed in cITP paediatric patients after achieving a sustained complete response."

35484920,HDAC3 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2530223 is associated with increased susceptibility and severity of primary immune thrombocytopenia.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune hemorrhagic disorder characterized by a low platelet count and increased risk of bleeding. We previously reported that low-dose chidamide, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, restores immune tolerance in patients with ITP. This study aimed to evaluate the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2530223 in the HDAC3 gene with susceptibility to ITP and its clinical features.
Patients with ITP and age-matched healthy participants were recruited for this case-control study. Genotyping of the HDAC3 rs2530223 polymorphism was performed using MassARRAY platform.
Individuals with T allele of HDAC3 rs2530223 exhibited a 1.472-fold increased risk of ITP susceptibility (OR 1.472; 95% CI 1.100-1.969; p = .009), while ones with the TT genotype under the codominant and recessive models, and the TC/TT genotypes under the dominant model all revealed increased risk of ITP susceptibility (dominant odds ratio[OR] 1.965; 95% CI: 1.046-3.656; p = .036; codominant OR 2.264; 95% CI 1.175-4.360; p = .015; and recessive OR 1.512; 95% CI 1.028-2.224; p = .036, respectively). Regarding platelet counts in ITP patients, we observed that the TC/TT genotypes exhibited a 3.932-fold increased risk for platelet (PLT) <30 × 10
This study indicates that HDAC3 rs2530223 may be an important genetic factor related to ITP susceptibility and platelet count in ITP patients, providing new perspectives on disease progression, new therapeutic targets, and severity prediction."

35483924,Recent advances in the management of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a potentially life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy caused by autoantibody-mediated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. TTP should be suspected in patients with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without a definite cause. Early detection of iTTP and prompt treatment with plasma exchange and corticosteroids are essential. Rituximab administration should be considered for refractory or relapsed iTTP, and can be used as a first-line adjuvant or preemptive therapy. Treatment with caplacizumab, a novel anti-von Willebrand factor nanobody, resulted in a faster time to platelet count response, significant reduction in iTTP-related deaths, and reduced incidence of refractory iTTP. TTP survivors showed a higher rate of chronic morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive impairment, which can lead to a poor quality of life and higher mortality rate. Meticulous long-term follow-up of TTP survivors is crucial."

Recruitment for this prospective, cross-sectional observational study of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy (platelet counts <100x10
A total of 150 pregnant women with thrombocytopenia were enrolled, with the mean age being 27.3±4.64 years. Mean platelet counts at baseline were 48.0±24. Main clinical manifestations at baseline included: anemia 65.9%, bruises 23.25%, and edema 9.3%. Causes of thrombocytopenia were gestational thrombocytopenia (GT) 72 (48%), acute fatty liver five (3.3%), pre-eclampsia in 11 (7.3%), and eclampsia seven (4.6%). Causes not specific to pregnancy included 30 (20%) cases of ITP, hepatitis C, and nutritional deficiency was reported in nine (6%) patients each. 72/150 received supportive care treatment to manage thrombocytopenia and were closely monitored and given supplements. Twenty (66.6%) ITP patients received treatment with steroids, with complete response in 70% of them seen. Overall, 38 (25.3%) women with bleeding symptoms and platelet count <50x10
The study shows that pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are serious conditions with a high risk for complications, while GT is a benign and the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy which requires no active treatment. The other causes such as ITP and infections require individualized management."

35471623,"Oseltamivir as rescue therapy for persistent, chronic, or refractory immune thrombocytopenia: a case series and review of the literature.","Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that results from antibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Novel therapies have emerged in the last decade, but 15-20% of patients will relapse or fail and require further therapy. We performed a prospective, single-arm intervention study on seven patients with chronic, persistent, or refractory ITP from the Hospital Universitario ""Dr. José E González"", in Monterrey, Mexico between 2015 and 2019. Eligible patients received oral oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days and were followed up for six months. Most patients received a median of three distinct therapies (range 2-6). Four patients (57.1%) received combined therapy. The median time for any response was 55.5 days (range = 14-150). All patients responded at some point in time (ORR = 100%, six had a proportion of loss of response [PR], and one achieved [CR]). Six months after oseltamivir administration, three patients (42.9%) maintained a response, and one patient had a CR (14.3%). Oseltamivir was well tolerated with a good overall response rate and was useful for treating chronic ITP. We observed an initial increase in the number of platelets; however, this response was not maintained."
35467751,Generic romiplostim for children with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia: Experience from a tertiary care centre in North India.,"Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are important therapeutic option in children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). We evaluated the response, efficacy, safety of a generic form of romiplostim manufactured in India for treating children with persistent/chronic ITP at our centre. Study of 45 children with persistent/chronic ITP was conducted of which 5 discontinued and 40 were included between 2019-2020. Patients received romiplostim for 20 weeks, at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/week. Platelet count at week 1, 3, 20 and 26 was assessed. Predesigned algorithm was used for dose adjustment. After 20 weeks, patients who had platelet count of 50 × 109/L or above were tapered off medication and monitored till 26 weeks. Median platelet count at enrolment was 11 x 109/L (IQR 23 X 109/L). 13/40 children had received >/= three lines of prior ITP therapy. Platelet response (platelet count rise to more than 50×109/L without rescue medications) observed in 26 (65%) patients at week 20. Rescue medication was used in 12/40 children. Sustained platelet response after tapering and stopping romiplostim observed in 22/40 children. No adverse events were considered serious or led to discontinuation of treatment. Our data demonstrated generic romiplostim is well tolerated and efficacious in children with persistent/chronic ITP."
35465977,Changes in incidence rates of outcomes of interest in vaccine safety studies during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused an abrupt drop in in-person health care (inpatient, Emergency Department, outpatient) and an increase in telehealth care, which poses challenges in vaccine safety studies that identify outcomes from in-person encounters. We examined the changes in incidence rates of selected encounter-based outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We assembled a cohort of members from 8 Vaccine Safety Datalink sites from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2020. Using ICD-10 diagnosis codes or laboratory criteria, we identified 21 incident outcomes in traditional in-person settings and all settings. We defined 4 periods in 2020: January-February (pre-pandemic), April-June (early pandemic), July-September (middle pandemic), and October-December (late pandemic). We defined four corresponding periods in each year during 2017-2019. We calculated incidence rates, conducted difference in difference (DiD) analyses, and reported ratios of incidence rate ratios (RRR) to examine changes in rates from pre-pandemic to early, middle, and late pandemic in 2020, after adjusting for changes across similar periods in 2017-2019.
Among > 10 million members, regardless of setting and after adjusting for changes during 2017-2019, we found that incidence rates of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis/myelitis/encephalomyelitis/meningoencephalitis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura did not significantly change from the pre-pandemic to early, middle or late pandemic periods (p-values ≥ 0.05). Incidence rates decreased from the pre-pandemic to early pandemic period during 2020 for acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, convulsions/seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), narcolepsy/cataplexy, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism (p-values < 0.05). Incidence rates of Bell's palsy, ITP, and narcolepsy/cataplexy were higher in all settings than in traditional in-person settings during the three pandemic periods (p-values < 0.05).
Rates of some clinical outcomes during the pandemic changed and should not be used as historical background rates in vaccine safety studies. Inclusion of telehealth visits should be considered for vaccine studies involving Bell's palsy, ITP, and narcolepsy/cataplexy."

35464467,Pathogenesis of Autoimmune Cytopenias in Inborn Errors of Immunity Revealing Novel Therapeutic Targets.,"Autoimmune diseases are usually associated with environmental triggers and genetic predisposition. However, a few number of autoimmune diseases has a monogenic cause, mostly in children. These diseases may be the expression, isolated or associated with other symptoms, of an underlying inborn error of immunity (IEI). Autoimmune cytopenias (AICs), including immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), autoimmune neutropenia (AN), and Evans' syndrome (ES) are common presentations of immunological diseases in the pediatric age, with at least 65% of cases of ES genetically determined. Autoimmune cytopenias in IEI have often a more severe, chronic, and relapsing course. Treatment refractoriness also characterizes autoimmune cytopenia with a monogenic cause, such as IEI. The mechanisms underlying autoimmune cytopenias in IEI include cellular or humoral autoimmunity, immune dysregulation in cases of hemophagocytosis or lymphoproliferation with or without splenic sequestration, bone marrow failure, myelodysplasia, or secondary myelosuppression. Genetic characterization of autoimmune cytopenias is of fundamental importance as an early diagnosis improves the outcome and allows the setting up of a targeted therapy, such as CTLA-4 IgG fusion protein (Abatacept), small molecule inhibitors (JAK-inhibitors), or gene therapy. Currently, gene therapy represents one of the most attractive targeted therapeutic approaches to treat selected inborn errors of immunity. Even in the absence of specific targeted therapies, however, whole exome genetic testing (WES) for children with chronic multilineage cytopenias should be considered as an early diagnostic tool for disease diagnosis and genetic counseling."
35464331,COVID-19 Presenting With a Challenging Combination of Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes various hematological abnormalities, leading to several complications in the disease course. We report two COVID-19 cases presenting with a combination of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy complications in late 2020. A 73-year-old male with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) presented with acute ischemic stroke and acute thrombocytopenia in the setting of COVID-19. He was managed with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and had a subsequent acute ischemic stroke with microhemorrhages. Another 72-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and chronic thrombocytopenia presenting with acute thrombocytopenia in the setting of COVID-19 was managed with steroids and IVIG. She had a coagulopathic complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) later in her disease course managed with inferior vena cava filter and low-dose enoxaparin, but she subsequently died with a bleeding complication of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Despite the aggressive ongoing research, the treatment options for severe COVID-19 are limited to date and the mortality remains high. Both these cases are examples of challenging situations that the physicians are currently facing with COVID-19 pandemic."

35450072,Association of Platelet Desialylation and Circulating Follicular Helper T Cells in Patients With Thrombocytopenia.,"Thrombocytopenia is a multifactorial condition that frequently involves concomitant defects in platelet production and clearance. The physiopathology of low platelet count in thrombocytopenia remains unclear. Sialylation on platelet membrane glycoprotein and follicular helper T cells (TFHs) are thought to be the novel platelet clearance pathways. The aim of this study was to clarify the roles of platelet desialylation and circulating TFHs in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and non-ITP thrombocytopenia. We enrolled 190 patients with ITP and 94 patients with non-ITP related thrombocytopenia including case of aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). One hundred and ten healthy volunteers were included as controls. We found significantly increased desialylated platelets in patients with ITP or thrombocytopenia in the context of AA and MDS. Platelet desialylation was negatively correlated with platelet count. Meanwhile, the circulating TFH levels in patients with thrombocytopenia were significantly higher than those of normal controls, and were positively correlated with desialylated platelet levels. Moreover, TFHs-related chemokine CXCL13 and apoptotic platelet levels were abnormally high in ITP patients. The upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and the activation of the MAPK/mTOR pathway were observed in the same cohort. These findings suggested that platelet desialylation and circulating TFHs may become the potential biomarkers for evaluating the disease process associated with thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP and non-ITP."
35446925,"Real-world impact of primary immune thrombocytopenia and treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists on quality of life based on patient-reported experience: Results from a questionnaire conducted in Switzerland, Austria, and Belgium.","Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are approved for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), but their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remains poorly investigated in clinical practice. This observational study aimed to gain insight into real-world patient-reported experiences of the burden of ITP and TPO-RAs.
An online questionnaire of closed questions was used to collect views of patients with primary ITP from Switzerland, Austria, and Belgium, between September 2018 and April 2020.
Of 46 patients who completed the questionnaire (total cohort), 41% were receiving TPO-RAs. A numerically higher proportion of patients reported being free from symptoms at the time of the questionnaire (54%) than at diagnosis (24%), irrespective of treatment type. Bleeding, the most frequently reported symptom at diagnosis (59%), was reduced at the time of the questionnaire (7%). Conversely, fatigue was reported by approximately 40% of patients at both diagnosis and the time of the questionnaire. Having a normal life and their disease under control was reported by 83% and 76%, respectively, but 41% were worried/anxious about their condition. Nearly 50% reported that ITP impaired their engagement in hobbies/sport or energy levels and 63% reported no impact on employment. When stratified by TPO-RA use, bleeding was better controlled in those receiving TPO-RAs than not (0% vs 11%). A numerically lower proportion receiving TPO-RAs than not reported worry/anxiety about their condition (16% vs 59%) and shifting from full-time to part-time employment (11% vs 22%). Similar proportions were satisfied with their therapy whether they were receiving TPO-RAs or not (89% vs 85%).
Many factors affect HRQoL in patients with ITP. Of patients receiving TPO-RAs, none experienced bleeding at the time of the questionnaire; they also showed a more positive perspective for some outcomes than those not using TPO-RAs. However, fatigue was not reduced by any treatment."

35434592,SARS-Cov2 acute and post-active infection in the context of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.,"The clinical and immunological spectrum of acute and post-active COVID-19 syndrome overlaps with criteria used to characterize autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Indeed, following SARS-Cov2 infection, the innate immune response is altered with an initial delayed production of interferon type I (IFN-I), while the NF-kappa B and inflammasome pathways are activated. In lung and digestive tissues, an alternative and extrafollicular immune response against SARS-Cov2 takes place with, consequently, an altered humoral and memory T cell response leading to breakdown of tolerance with the emergence of autoantibodies. However, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 among SLE and RA patients did not exceed the general population except in those having pre-existing neutralizing autoantibodies against IFN-I. Treatment discontinuation rather than COVID-19 infection or vaccination increases the risk of developing flares. Last but not least, a limited number of case reports of individuals having developed SLE or RA following COVID-19 infection/vaccination have been reported. Altogether, the SARS-Cov2 pandemic represents an unique opportunity to investigate the dangerous interplay between the immune response against infectious agents and autoimmunity, and to better understand the triggering role of infection as a risk factor in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease development."
35432552,Psychotic Disorder as the First Manifestation of Addison Disease: A Case Report.,"Addison disease is a relatively uncommon endocrine disease resulting from adrenal insufficiency. Psychiatric symptoms are among its rare primary and particularly isolated clinical symptoms. This report presents a case with adrenal insufficiency manifested by the psychotic syndrome.
A 28-year-old Iranian female with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and asthma since childhood presented with a 13-month history of progressive depression with insomnia and nightmare symptoms. After being prescribed haloperidol, clomipramine, and clonazepam for eight months, abdominal pain and weight loss due to anorexia started. Her physical examination showed skin hyperpigmentation in the elbow, knee, ankle, and buccal mucosa. Physical examination and initial laboratory tests suggested adrenal insufficiency. Addison disease was confirmed according to the laboratory tests and abdominal CT. The symptoms were significantly improved using intravenous hydrocortisone treatment. The patient remained calm and had a normal sleep without depressive symptoms or psychosis after 72 hours of treatment. During one year of follow-up, the patient was in good general condition without psychological symptoms.
This report shows that psychotic disorder can be the first manifestation of Addison disease. Therefore, physicians should be informed about the neuropsychiatric symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, especially when the patient lacks a family or personal history of psychiatric illness."
35430727,The use of obinutuzumab and ofatumumab in the treatment of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, can be used to treat immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) during acute presentation or disease relapse. Undesirable side-effects include severe hypersensitivity reactions, particularly anaphylaxis and rituximab-induced serum sickness, with a minority not maintaining a response to treatment. Alternative humanised anti-CD20 treatments, obinutuzumab and ofatumumab, have been used. A review of the UK TTP Registry showed 15 patients received these drugs over 26 treatment episodes (eight obinutuzumab and 18 ofatumumab). Indications for alternative anti-CD20 treatment were severe infusion-related reactions, acute rituximab-induced serum sickness and a short duration of disease remission. All patients achieved disease remission (ADAMTS13 [A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13] activity ≥30 iu/dl) after a median 15 days and 92% of episodes achieved complete remission (≥60 iu/dl). Seven patients required further treatment for disease relapse with a median relapse-free survival of 17.4 months. All patients continued to respond to re-treatment with the preceding drug when relapse occurred. There were four adverse events in 26 treatment episodes (15%) - two infections and two infusion reactions. These results suggest that obinutuzumab and ofatumumab may be considered as an alternative option to rituximab in the treatment of iTTP with a comparable safety profile, absence of significant hypersensitivity reactions and sustained normalisation of ADAMTS13."

In an international, adaptive, open-label, dose-finding, phase 1-2 clinical trial, we evaluated rilzabrutinib therapy in previously treated patients with immune thrombocytopenia. We used intrapatient dose escalation of oral rilzabrutinib over a period of 24 weeks; the lowest starting dose was 200 mg once daily, with higher starting doses of 400 mg once daily, 300 mg twice daily, and 400 mg twice daily. The primary end points were safety and platelet response (defined as at least two consecutive platelet counts of ≥50×10
Sixty patients were enrolled. At baseline, the median platelet count was 15×10
Rilzabrutinib was active and associated with only low-level toxic effects at all dose levels. The dose of 400 mg twice daily was identified as the dose for further testing. Overall, rilzabrutinib showed a rapid and durable clinical activity that improved with length of treatment.

35414712,Glucocorticoid receptor modulates myeloid-derived suppressor cell function via mitochondrial metabolism in immune thrombocytopenia.,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature cells and natural inhibitors of adaptive immunity. Intracellular metabolic changes in MDSCs exert a direct immunological influence on their suppressive activity. Our previous study demonstrated that high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM) corrected the functional impairment of MDSCs in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); however, the MDSC population was not restored in nonresponders, and the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, altered mitochondrial physiology and reduced mitochondrial gene transcription were detected in MDSCs from HD-DXM nonresponders, accompanied by decreased levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Blockade of FAO with a CPT-1 inhibitor abolished the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs in HD-DXM responders. We also report that MDSCs from ITP patients had lower expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which can translocate into mitochondria to regulate the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as the level of oxidative phosphorylation. It was confirmed that the expression of CPT-1 and mtDNA-encoded genes was downregulated in GR-siRNA-treated murine MDSCs. Finally, by establishing murine models of active and passive ITP via adoptive transfer of DXM-modulated MDSCs, we confirmed that GR-silenced MDSCs failed to alleviate thrombocytopenia in mice with ITP. In conclusion, our study indicated that impaired aerobic metabolism in MDSCs participates in the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid resistance in ITP and that intact control of MDSC metabolism by GR contributes to the homeostatic regulation of immunosuppressive cell function."

This phase 3b, single-arm, multicenter study investigated long-term efficacy and safety of romiplostim in children ≥1 to <18 years old with ≥6 months' ITP duration and platelet counts ≤30 × 109/L. Children received weekly subcutaneous romiplostim (1 μg/kg titrated to 10 μg/kg) to maintain platelets within 50 to 200 × 109/L. A subset underwent bone marrow examinations. The primary end point was percentage of time with platelet response during the first 6 months' treatment (counts ≥50 × 109/L without rescue medication within the preceding 4 weeks). Overall, 203 patients (median age, 10.0 years) received ≥1 dose of romiplostim, median treatment duration was ∼3 years, and median average weekly dose was 6.9 μg/kg. Ninety-five (46.8%) discontinued (lack of efficacy, n = 43 [21.2%]). Platelet responses were achieved a median (interquartile range) of 50.0% (16.7%-83.3%) of the time during the first 6 months, increasing to 78.2% (26.7%-90.4%) during the overall 36-month treatment period. Eleven patients (5.4%) achieved sustained responses (consecutive counts ≥50 × 109/L without ITP medications for ≥24 weeks). Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 56 patients (27.6%), with 8 (3.9%) experiencing serious treatment-related AEs; all of these led to discontinuation, including 4 cases of neutralizing antibodies (romiplostim, n = 3; TPO, n = 1). Bleeding occurred in 141 patients (69.5%), decreasing over time; grade ≥3 bleeding events occurred in 20 (9.9%). At year 2, eight of 63 evaluable patients (12.7%) had grade 2 reticulin. Long-term romiplostim resulted in sustained on-treatment platelet responses with an overall safety profile consistent with previous studies. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02279173."

35411373,Fitness to Serve in the Armed Forces and Internal Medicine: A Retrospective Study.,"Assessment of the medical fitness to serve in the armed forces has two objectives: to prevent the military operations from being jeopardized by a medical issue, and to protect soldiers from the sequelae of diseases that could become complicated in the operational field, especially in overseas operations where soldiers are exposed to a remote setting and a long evacuation time. Little is known about fitness decisions for soldiers with systemic or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, we conducted a single-center retrospective study of internal medicine fitness decisions.
All the fitness decisions discussed from September 2019 to December 2020 in our department of internal medicine were reviewed. Gender, age, army or service, rank, garrison and health topic were collected from the medical files. Our Military Hospital local ethics committee, in accordance with the French law, approved this study.
There were 41 cases, involving 31 men and 10 women (mean age: 31 years), presenting with autoimmune or systemic diseases, metabolic disorders, thrombophilia, congenital or acquired malformations or organ failure, miscellaneous nephropathies, or hemogram abnormalities. Four patients were taking immunosuppressive agents, 3 biologics, and 4 anticoagulants. Among the 15 civilians requiring medical fitness assessment to enlistment, 6 were declared fit. They presented with a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis with intermediate uveitis without relapse for 7 years, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome type II with ectopic kidney, solitary kidney with normal renal function and with hypertension, isolated proteinuria, proteinuria with microscopic hematuria, and muscular fibrolipoma with a history of surgical treatment of a vascular malformation. Among the 26 patients already enlisted in the armed forces, 9 were referred for assessment of medical fitness to serve overseas. Two soldiers were assessed as fit without restrictions; one presented with a history of a single episode of deep vein thrombosis after surgery, and the other had a history of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance without relapse and without treatment for 8 years. Four soldiers were assessed as fit only for overseas territories with sanitary structures similar to mainland France. They presented with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, mevalonate kinase deficiency and treatment with anakinra, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and history of unilateral partial renal infarction. The 17 other soldiers were referred for dispensation, long-sickness leave granting, or for specification toward administrative coding of their disease.
We have described the first exhaustive study of specialized fitness decisions referred to an internal medicine department. One-third of the referred patients were declared fit to serve in the armed forces. Further studies are needed to confirm these results, as our study was monocentric. Fitness decisions must take into account the disease, the treatment, and the operational field characteristics. Soldiers with systemic diseases controlled by immunosuppressive agents can serve in tropical areas if they can reach adequate sanitary structures in a short time. The knowledge of systemic diseases as well as the skillfulness of the internists, which are regularly projected to the operational fields, allows them to provide pragmatic fitness expertise to myriad complex situations."
35405676,Association between P-Selectin Autoantibody Positive and Response to Steroid Treatment in Newly Diagnosed Immune Thrombocytopenia Patients.,"This study aimed to detect the association between P-selectin autoantibody positive and response to steroid treatment in newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients.
The data from 105 newly diagnosed adult ITP patients administered with first-line of steroid treatment from October 2016 to May 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment responses were evaluated within 3 months after the onset of treatment.
Among the 105 patients, 80.00% (84/105) of patients presented with platelet glycoprotein-specific antibody positive; 44.76% (47/105) patients were anti-P-selectin positive, while 35.24% (37/105) were anti-P-selectin negative. No significant difference in overall response was observed between patients who were anti-P-selectin positive and those who were anti-P-selectin negative (74.47% vs. 89.19, χ2 = 2.910, p = 0.088). But patients who were anti-P-selectin negative had significantly higher complete response rate, compared to those who were anti-P-selectin positive (72.97% vs. 48.94%, χ2 = 4,965, p = 0.026). Logistic regression analysis revealed that anti-GP IIb/IIIa positive (OR = 3.114, p = 0.010, 95% CI: 1.313-7.388) and anti-P-selectin positive (OR = 0.309, p = 0.036, 95% CI: 0.127-0.753) were two factors that could affect patients' response.
Our study found that ITP patients with anti-GP IIb/IIIa may have a higher response to steroid treatment, but anti-P-selectin-mediated-ITP might be less responsive to steroid treatment. In adults with ITP, the presence of anti-P-selectin autoantibodies is a predictive factor for poor response to steroid treatment."
35402843,Ultrastructural alterations of megakaryocytes in thrombocytopenia: A review of 43 cases.,"Thrombocytopenia is a frequent occurrence in a variety of hematopoietic diseases; however, the details of the mechanism leading to low platelet count remain elusive. Megakaryocytes are a series of progenitor cells responsible for the production of platelets. Alterations in megakaryocytes in the bone marrow are a causative factor resulting in thrombocytopenia in varied diseases. Based on ultrastructural analysis of incidentally encountered megakaryocytes in 43 patients with blood diseases marked by low platelet counts, electron micrographs demonstrated that aberrant megakaryocytes predominated in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome; autophagy, apoptosis, and cellular damage in megakaryocytes were a prominent feature in aplastic anemia. On the other hand, poorly differentiated megakaryocytes predominated in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) although damaged megakaryocytes were seen in non-AMKL acute leukemia. This paper documents the ultrastructural alterations of megakaryocytes associated with thrombocytopenia and reveals distinctive features for particular blood diseases. A comment is made on future avenues of research emphasizing membrane fusion proteins."
35401530,"IgG4 Autoantibodies in Organ-Specific Autoimmunopathies: Reviewing Class Switching, Antibody-Producing Cells, and Specific Immunotherapies.","Organ-specific autoimmunity is often characterized by autoantibodies targeting proteins expressed in the affected tissue. A subgroup of autoimmunopathies has recently emerged that is characterized by predominant autoantibodies of the IgG4 subclass (IgG4-autoimmune diseases; IgG4-AID). This group includes pemphigus vulgaris, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, subtypes of autoimmune encephalitis, inflammatory neuropathies, myasthenia gravis and membranous nephropathy. Although the associated autoantibodies target specific antigens in different organs and thus cause diverse syndromes and diseases, they share surprising similarities in genetic predisposition, disease mechanisms, clinical course and response to therapies. IgG4-AID appear to be distinct from another group of rare immune diseases associated with IgG4, which are the IgG4-related diseases (IgG4-RLD), such as IgG4-related which have distinct clinical and serological properties and are not characterized by antigen-specific IgG4. Importantly, IgG4-AID differ significantly from diseases associated with IgG1 autoantibodies targeting the same organ. This may be due to the unique functional characteristics of IgG4 autoantibodies (e.g. anti-inflammatory and functionally monovalent) that affect how the antibodies cause disease, and the differential response to immunotherapies of the IgG4 producing B cells/plasmablasts. These clinical and pathophysiological clues give important insight in the immunopathogenesis of IgG4-AID. Understanding IgG4 immunobiology is a key step towards the development of novel, IgG4 specific treatments. In this review we therefore summarize current knowledge on IgG4 regulation, the relevance of class switching in the context of health and disease, describe the cellular mechanisms involved in IgG4 production and provide an overview of treatment responses in IgG4-AID."

We herein report a 90-year-old man who received the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2) and developed severe thrombocytopenia with intracranial hemorrhaging and duodenal bleeding, consistent with vaccine-related ITP. He was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisolone, and eltrombopag and discharged without cytopenia. Vaccine-related ITP should be suspected in patients presenting with abnormal bleeding or purpura after vaccination."
35396605,Real-world experience of anti-D immunoglobulin in immune thrombocytopenia.,"In developing countries, anti-D has been used in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as a cheaper alternative to human immunoglobulin. We aim to analyze the response and safety profile of anti-D in patients with severe ITP. A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Northern India. Patients received a single intravenous infusion of 75 μg/kg anti-D. In total, 36 patients (20 females) were included in this study. The median duration from ITP diagnosis to anti-D therapy was 235 days (range 1-1613 days). Four (11.1%) patients received anti-D as an upfront treatment. The patients' platelet counts rose significantly by the end of day three and continued to be significantly high until day 30 of receiving anti-D (p ≤ 0.001). The overall response rate (ORR) by day seven was 88.89%. There was no effect of age, sex, duration of disease, prior therapy, and platelet count on the ORR. Patients were followed up for a median duration of 52 days (longest follow-up: 3080 days). Six (6/36, 16.67%) patients continued to be in remission till the last follow-up. The hemoglobin fall was statistically significant on day three and day seven (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001) and got normalized by day 30. We observed equally good ORR in mixed populations and different phases of ITP along with long-term sustained response. The study demonstrates a quick and high response rate along with good safety profile to anti-D in all forms of ITP."
35391624,Proposal for a New Protocol for the Management of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP).,"For many decades immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) was managed using therapies which had not undergone randomised clinical trials and included corticosteroids, immune suppression or splenectomy. These older therapies are associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. These empirical therapies have variable efficacy and well-described side effects for many patients with minimal benefit to the patient. Over the past 10 years there has been a shift away from immune suppression and non-evidence-based therapies towards using treatments with reduced or no immune suppression with an increasing reliance on the recently developed and approved thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has made it more urgent that we develop non-immune suppressive strategies for ITP. In this commentary we describe our proposal for a contemporary approach to the management of ITP in adults that is based on our hospital practices and published guidelines."
35385923,The deglycosylated form of 1E12 inhibits platelet activation and prothrombotic effects induced by VITT antibodies.,"In order to improve the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, there is an urgent need to unravel the pathogenesis of vaccineinduced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), a severe complication of recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines used to prevent COVID-19, and likely due to anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) IgG antibodies. In this study, we demonstrated that 1E12, a chimeric anti-PF4 antibody with a human Fc fragment, fully mimics the effects of human VITT antibodies, as it activates platelets to a similar level in the presence of platelet factor 4 (PF4). Incubated with neutrophils, platelets and PF4, 1E12 also strongly induces NETosis, and in a microfluidic model of whole blood thrombosis, it triggers the formation of large platelet/leukocyte thrombi containing fibrin(ogen). In addition, a deglycosylated form of 1E12 (DG-1E12), which still binds PF4 but no longer interacts with Fcγ receptors, inhibits platelet, granulocyte and clotting activation induced by human anti-PF4 VITT antibodies. This strongly supports that 1E12 and VITT antibodies recognize overlapping epitopes on PF4. In conclusion, 1E12 is a potentially important tool to study the pathophysiology of VITT, and for establishing mouse models. On the other hand, DG-1E12 may help the development of a new drug that specifically neutralizes the pathogenic effect of autoimmune anti-PF4 antibodies, such as those associated with VITT."
35383565,Factors associated with secondary immune thrombocytopenia in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome: a retrospective study of 639 cases.,"To investigate the clinical characteristics and relevant factors of secondary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).
Patients with pSS being treated between 2013 and 2020 in China-Japan Friendship Hospital were retrospectively analysed. Clinical characteristics were compared between pSS patients with and without secondary ITP. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with secondary ITP in patients with pSS.
639 patients with pSS were included in this study, among which 566 (88.6%) were women. The prevalence of secondary ITP in patients with pSS were 12.4%. Among pSS patients with secondary ITP, 55.7% had mucocutaneous bleeding and 8.9% experienced visceral bleeding. Lymphopenia (OR=3.154, 95% CI 1.185-8.395, p=0.021), anaemia (OR=2.416, 95% CI 1.250-4.668, p=0.009), low C4 (OR=2.904, 95% CI 1.563-5.394, p=0.001), and positive anti-RNP (OR=2.777, 95% CI 1.070-7.202, p=0.036) were significantly related to secondary ITP, while interstitial lung disease (ILD, OR=0.429, 95% CI 0.203-0.907, p=0.027), ANA ≥1:320 (OR=0.469, 95% CI 0.221-0.996, p=0.049) and positive anti-SSB (OR=0.288, 95% CI 0.126-0.685, p=0.003) were negatively associated with secondary ITP in patients with pSS.
Over 10% of patients with pSS had secondary ITP, among whom visceral bleeding was comparatively rare. Lymphopenia and anaemia were positively related to secondary ITP, while ILD was negatively associated with secondary ITP. Low C4 and positive anti-RNP seem to be two potential risk factors for secondary ITP in patients with pSS, while ANA ≥1:320 and positive anti-SSB may be two potential protective factors."
35380017,Intravenous Immunoglobulin to Suppress Progression in a Patient With Advanced Breast Cancer.,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used to treat various diseases and has anticancer effects that suppress metastases in animal models of sarcoma and melanoma. However, these effects have been observed in a limited number of clinical cases. We report the case of a patient with metastatic breast cancer in which long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in the absence of salvage chemotherapy. The patient was treated with IVIG for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Surprisingly, the lung and brain metastases were stabilized, and the patient achieved a progression-free interval of 29 months. More cases are needed to investigate and confirm the efficacy of IVIG in solid tumors in the future."
35371812,Use of Eltrombopag for the First Trimester Pregnancy Complicated with Refractory Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Severe idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is thought to occur in approximately one in 10,000 pregnancies and refractoriness for conventional treatment is life-threatening. We herein describe a pregnant case of refractory ITP successfully treated with eltrombopag, orally medicated thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA). The patient was diagnosed with ITP at the age of 22 and corticosteroid, immune globulin treatments, or splenectomy was invalid. Eltrombopag was administered at 25 mg/day and the platelet count was maintained at 50-80 × 10"
35366433,HMGB1 is increased in patients with immune thrombocytopenia and negatively associates with Tregs.,"Refractory or recurrent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients suffer from the dual threat of high mortality and drug toxicity in addition to a very poor quality of life. Previous studies have shown that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) can promote the development of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune diseases. However, there is still a lack of research on the role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of ITP and whether it can be used as a predictor of efficacy and prognosis.
20 patients of adult ITP with splenectomy were chosen as the experimental group, while 19 adults underwent splenectomy for traumatic splenic rupture without other diseases as the control group. We measured the expression of HMGB1, RORγt and Foxp3 in spleen tissues by immunohistochemistry. Another 50 patients, of which 20 were newly diagnosed without treatment and 30 were refractory ITP, and 25 healthy controls were enrolled to analyse the expression levels and mRNA levels of HMGB1, RORγt and Foxp3 in peripheral blood by Western blot and RT-qPCR. The expression of HMGB1, IL-17 and IL-10 in serum was assayed by ELISA. PBMCs from newly diagnosed ITP patients were cultured in vitro which stimulated with recombinant humanHMGB1 (rHMGB1) and its inhibitors, in which the expressions of RORγt and Foxp3 were measured.
The expression of HMGB1 in the spleen with refractory ITP was significantly higher, while Foxp3 was decreased. A significant negative correlation was found between HMGB1 and Foxp3, and the overexpression of HMGB1 was significantly correlated with poor efficacy after splenectomy. The expression of HMGB1 and IL-17 increased and showed a positive correlation in serum, while IL-10 decreased and was negatively correlated with HMGB1. In PBMCs, the expression of HMGB1 and RORγt increased, while Foxp3 decreased, and the differences were more obvious in the refractory chronic ITP group. In a coculture system with PBMCs of untreated ITP patients, rHMGB1 increased RORγt expression and decreased Foxp3 expression, while an antiHMGB1 antibody partially corrected the above changes.
Our results suggest that HMGB1 is associated with the imbalance of Treg/Th17 cells and is involved in the pathogenesis of ITP."
35365994,[Functional deficiency of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with immune thrombocytopenia: An update].,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune hemorrhagic disorder characterized by persistent thrombocytopenia. It may be induced by different pathogenesis due to its heterogeneity, and the therapeutic effects vary on different patients. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) can modulate innate and adaptive immunity, thus resulting in a tolerant microenvironment. Functional defects and immunomodulatory disorders of BMMSCs are significant causes of ITP. Functional effects associated with the activation of the P53 pathway include decreased activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT pathway and activation of the TNFAIP3/NF-κB/SMAD7 pathway. Immune dysfunction appears to be correlated with an impaired ability of BMMSCs to induce various types of immune cells in ITP. An in-depth investigation into the pathogenesis of ITP facilitates the treatment of ITP, but larger-scale clinical trials are needed to verify the efficacy of exogenous BMMSCs in the clinical treatment of ITP."
35363211,Successful treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with plasmapheresis and anti-CD20 antibodies in a patient with immune thrombocytopenia and systemic lupus erythematosus: Case report.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology with diverse clinical and laboratory manifestations, including thrombocytopenia. About 25% of patients with SLE may be affected by thrombocytopenia, many of whom are asymptomatic. Some patients, however, experience platelet counts that drop quite low and predispose them to bleeding. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is defined with a classic pentad of clinical features, such as thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms and signs, renal symptoms and signs, and fever. The association of TTP and SLE has been sporadically reported in the literature.
We describe a 16-year-old girl with SLE and immune thrombocytopenia, in whom TTP was diagnosed.
She was treated with pulse methylprednisolone, whose platelet counts normalized after therapy with plasmapheresis and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab).
A pediatric patient with SLE and immune thrombocytopenia in whom TTP developed was treated with plasmapheresis and rituximab therapy successfully, though the patient experienced a disease relapsed after 18 months, which was controlled by the same management."
35359156,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and other immune-mediated blood disorders following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.,
35359002,A novel flow cytometry procoagulant assay for diagnosis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a severe prothrombotic complication of adenoviral vaccines, including the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria) vaccine. The putative mechanism involves formation of pathological anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies that activate platelets via the low-affinity immunoglobulin G receptor FcγRIIa to drive thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Functional assays are important for VITT diagnosis, as not all detectable anti-PF4 antibodies are pathogenic, and immunoassays have varying sensitivity. Combination of ligand binding of G protein-coupled receptors (protease-activated receptor-1) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-linked receptors (FcγRIIa) synergistically induce procoagulant platelet formation, which supports thrombin generation. Here, we describe a flow cytometry-based procoagulant platelet assay using cell death marker GSAO and P-selectin to diagnose VITT by exposing donor whole blood to patient plasma in the presence of a protease-activated receptor-1 agonist. Consecutive patients triaged for confirmatory functional VITT testing after screening using PF4/heparin ELISA were evaluated. In a development cohort of 47 patients with suspected VITT, plasma from ELISA-positive patients (n = 23), but not healthy donors (n = 32) or individuals exposed to the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine without VITT (n = 24), significantly increased the procoagulant platelet response. In a validation cohort of 99 VITT patients identified according to clinicopathologic adjudication, procoagulant flow cytometry identified 93% of VITT cases, including ELISA-negative and serotonin release assay-negative patients. The in vitro effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and fondaparinux trended with the clinical response seen in patients. Induction of FcγRIIa-dependent procoagulant response by patient plasma, suppressible by heparin and IVIg, is highly indicative of VITT, resulting in a sensitive and specific assay that has been adopted as part of a national diagnostic algorithm to identify vaccinated patients with platelet-activating antibodies."
35358438,The rollercoaster of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.,
35354570,Vaccination-associated immune thrombocytopenia possibly due to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) coronavirus vaccine.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired haemorrhagic diathesis of immune-mediated destruction, impaired production or increased splenic sequestration of platelets. It can be idiopathic (primary) or secondary (infections, medications, HIV infection, malignancies, connective tissue diseases or rarely secondary to vaccination). ITP postvaccination is termed vaccine-associated ITP (VITP) and is known to be caused by vaccines against various infectious agents such as measles-mumps-rubella, "
35354403,Downregulation of ADAM17 in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia impairs proplatelet formation.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common etiology of acquired thrombocytopenia diseases in children. ITP is characterized by the immune-mediated decreased formation and excessive destruction of platelets. The pathogenesis and management of pediatric ITP are distinct from adult ITP. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) mediates the shedding of platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib α (GPIb α) in extracellular domain, functioning in the platelet activation and clearance. Our study aims to probe the roles and mechanisms of ADAM17 in pediatric ITP.
The differently expressed ADAM17 in megakaryocytes was obtained from children with ITP through the next-generation RNA-Sequence. Hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa staining were performed for cell morphology identification. Flow cytometry was applied to assess autoantibodies against platelets, subtypes of lymphocytes, the surface expression level of ADAM17 and polyploidization of megakaryocytes, as well as the full-length GP Ib α.
ADAM17 was significantly downregulated in megakaryocytes and platelets in children with ITP. Higher values of PDW and positive autoantibodies presence were observed in children with ITP. Loss of ADAM17 in mice led to defects in proplatelet formation and significantly elevated expression of phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) in megakaryocytes.
Our study indicated that the downregulation of ADAM17 might be an innate cause of inefficient platelet production in pediatric ITP."
35352601,Coexistence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and immune thrombocytopenic purpura in an Asian woman: a case report.,"A 33-year-old Chinese woman with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura presented with heavy menstrual bleeding. She was found to have thrombocytopenia, plasma ADAMTS13 activity of 0%, and positivity for the plasma ADAMTS13 inhibitor. She was diagnosed with the coexistence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The patient was treated by plasmapheresis, a glucocorticoid, and rituximab. Her platelet level returned to normal, and she was discharged 28 days after admission. The number of plasmapheresis sessions and the timing of rituximab administration may be the key aspects of management of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura who have underlying immune dysfunction caused by diseases such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura."
35350251,COVID-19-induced immune thrombocytopenic purpura; Immunopathogenesis and clinical implications.,"Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people around the world have been affected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to the typical symptoms, thrombotic events, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is one of the thrombotic events that occur in some COVID-19 patients. Hyperinflammation, cytokine storms, and immune dysregulation in some patients are the cause to the main COVID-19 complications such as ALI (acute lung injury), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. Disruption in the differentiation of T-cells, enhanced differentiation of Th17 and Th1, cell death (pyroptosis), hyper-inflammation and dysfunction of inflammatory neutrophils and macrophages, and hyperactivity of NLRP3-inflammasome are among the important factors that may be the cause to COVID-19-induced ITP. This study aimed to give an overview of the findings on the immunopathogenesis of ITP and COVID-19-induced ITP. Further studies are required to better understand the exact immunopathogenesis and effective treatments for ITP, especially in inflammatory disorders."
35349645,Src-related thrombocytopenia: a fine line between a megakaryocyte dysfunction and an immune-mediated disease.,"Src-related thrombocytopenia (SRC-RT) is a rare autosomal dominant, inherited platelet disorder resulting from the p.E527K heterozygous germline gain-of-function variant of Src. To date, genetic diagnosis of the disease has only been reported in 7 patients from 3 unrelated families. The clinical features ranged from isolated thrombocytopenia to complex syndromic manifestations characterized by thrombocytopenia, bleeding, myelofibrosis, splenomegaly, and bone disease. We report a new 3-generation kindred with the Src p.E527K variant. Patients presented with rather variable platelet counts (38-139 × 109/L), mildly impaired platelet function, >15% immature platelet fraction, and with a significant proportion of large-giant platelets. Four adults from the family were diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and underwent splenectomy, achieving sustained platelet counts >75 × 109/L for several years; increases in platelet counts were also observed after corticosteroid therapy. Four of 7 Src p.E527K variant carriers showed immune defects and recurrent infections. In addition, a range of neurological symptoms, from specific language impairment to epilepsy, was seen in some family members. Patient platelets exhibited constitutive Src, Bruton tyrosine kinase, and phospholipase Cγ2 activation, and after stimulating CD19 cells by crosslinking surface immunoglobulin M, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly increased in B cells from individuals carrying the Src p.E527K substitution. In summary, in addition to causing impaired platelet production, SRC-RT may associate immune dysregulation and increased platelet consumption. In families in whom several members are responsive to ITP-directed therapies, an underlying Src p.E527K variant should be excluded."
35349562,Distribution of peripheral blood cells after splenectomy in immune thrombocytopenia patients.,"There are some difficulties regarding the evaluation of the post-splenectomy state.
The objective of the study is to compare the post-splenectomy blood changes of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients with those of trauma patients, 1 month and ≥ 6 months after surgery.
Medical records of patients, who had undergone total splenectomy for ITP and trauma at a tertiary center between January 2009 and December 2019, were retrospectively reviewed.
The current study included 52 patients, who had undergone splenectomy for ITP (57.7%), and trauma (42.3%). Splenectomy, irrespective of the indications, resulted in an increase in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and platelet levels. Neutrophils were responsible for the preoperative leukocytosis in ITP patients, and neutrophilia was ameliorated by splenectomy and also withdrawal of the steroid therapy in some patients. Decreased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio supported the finding that splenectomy ameliorated inflammation in ITP patients. Splenectomy resulted in a change in percentages of leukocytes in favor of basophils in ITP patients.
Splenectomy, irrespective of the indications, resulted in an increase in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet levels, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts. Splenectomy ameliorated inflammation in ITP patients and resulted in a change in percentages of leukocytes in favor of basophils.
Existen algunas dificultades con respecto a la evaluación del estado post-esplenectomía.
Comparar los cambios sanguíneos post-esplenectomía de pacientes con PTI con los de pacientes traumatizados, 1 mes y ≥ 6 meses después de la cirugía.
Se revisaron retrospectivamente las historias clínicas de los pacientes que habían sido sometidos a esplenectomía total por PTI y trauma en un centro terciario entre enero de 2009 y diciembre de 2019.
El presente estudio incluyó a 52 pacientes, que habían sido sometidos a esplenectomía por PTI (57.7%) y traumatismo (42.3%). La esplenectomía, independientemente de las indicaciones, resultó en un aumento de la concentración de hemoglobina, hematocrito y niveles de plaquetas. Los neutrófilos fueron responsables de la leucocitosis preoperatoria en pacientes con PTI, y la neutrofilia mejoró mediante esplenectomía y también la suspensión de la terapia con esteroides en algunos pacientes. La disminución de NLR y PLR apoyó el hallazgo de una disminución de la inflamación en la esplenectomía en pacientes con PTI. La esplenectomía resultó en un cambio en los porcentajes de leucocitos a favor de los basófilos en pacientes con PTI.
La esplenectomía, independientemente de las indicaciones, resultó en un aumento de la concentración de hemoglobina, niveles de hematocrito y plaquetas, recuentos de linfocitos, monocitos y eosinófilos.

35348426,Association between megakaryocyte abnormalities on bone marrow smear and response to thrombopoietin receptor agonists in adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia.,"Impaired platelet production is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Morphological abnormalities of megakaryocytes (MKs) are sometimes observed in this disease. Two studies have suggested an association between MK abnormalities and response to corticosteroids in primary ITP, but none have investigated this association for thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs). This was the aim of this study. The source of population was the French CARMEN registry with prospective follow-up of adult patients with incident ITP. We included patients with primary ITP, treated by TPO-RA and with a bone marrow smear before initiating TPO-RA. MK abnormalities were categorized by the presence of dysplasia and by the stage of maturation. Among 451 patients screened, 38 were included in the analysis. There was no difference in the median percentage of dysplastic MKs between responders to TPO-RA (4.0%, 95% confidence interval - CI: 2.3-6.4) and non-responders (4.5%, 95% CI: 0.7-7.1). There was a slightly higher proportion of granular MKs (4.5%, 95% CI: 3-6) and basophilic MKs (30.1%, 95% CI: 21.9-39.1) in non-responders compared to responders (granular: 2.0%, 95% CI: 0-4.1; basophilic: 21.3%, 95% CI: 11.4-40.7). In conclusion, MK abnormalities were not associated with response achievement in ITP patients treated with TPO-RA in this series of 38 patients."
35342100,Splenic surgery: a ten years experience of a tertiary center in Turkey.,"Splenectomy has been performed for various indications. In this study, we aimed to present the experience of a tertiary center on splenic surgery and analyze what has changed in the last 10 years.
Three hundred and sixteen patients who underwent splenic surgery were enrolled in the study. Demographic data, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, indications, operation type, postoperative complications, and mortality were analyzed retrospectively.
The most common indication was traumatic splenic injury. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and gastric cancer were the second and third. Splenectomy was performed on 300 (94.9%) patients. Splenorrhaphy, partial splenectomy, and splenopexy were the other procedures performed. Postoperative complications occurred in almost onethird of the patients (n=118, 37.3%). Most of them were grade 5 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.
Splenectomy has become a less preferred treatment option with the development of non-operative management in splenic trauma, medical treatments for hematological diseases, and a better understanding of the immune, hematological and metabolic functions of the spleen. In the future, minimally invasive and spleen-sparing surgeries will be performed more frequently for patients who need splenectomy even for those with trauma.

La splenectomia è stata eseguita per varie indicazioni. In questo studio, abbiamo voluto presentare l’esperienza di un centro terziario sulla chirurgia splenica e analizzare cosa è cambiato negli ultimi 10 anni. Sono stati arruolati nello studio trecentosedici pazienti sottoposti a chirurgia splenica. I dati demografici, le comorbilità, il punteggio dell’American Society of Anesthesiologists, le indicazioni, il tipo di operazione, le complicanze postoperatorie e la mortalità sono stati analizzati retrospettivamente. L’indicazione più comune alla chirurgia della milza è rappresentata da una lesione traumatica. La porpora trombocitopenica immune (ITP) e il cancro gastrico rappresentano la seconda e la terza indicazione. La splenectomia è stata eseguita su 300 (94,9%) pazienti. La splenorrafia, la splenectomia parziale e la splenopessia sono state le altre procedure eseguite. Complicanze postoperatorie si sono verificate in quasi un terzo dei pazienti (n=118, 37,3%). La maggior parte di loro era di grado 5 secondo la classificazione Clavien-Dindo. İn conclusione la splenectomia si è dimostrata una scelta in diminuzione per il trattamento delle lesioni traumatiche della milza, con lo sviluppo dell’atteggiamento conservatico, con i trattamenti medici per le malattie ematologiche e una migliore comprensione delle funzioni immunitarie, ematologiche e metaboliche della milza. In futuro, gli interventi chirurgici mini invasivi e la chirurgia conservativa della milza saranno eseguiti più frequentemente per i pazienti un tempo trattai con splenectomia, anche nel caso dei traumi."

Eighteen studies of VITT after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or Ad26.COV2.S vaccine administration were reviewed from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. The meta-analysis estimated the summary effects and between-study heterogeneity regarding the incidence, manifestations, sites of thrombosis, diagnostic findings, and clinical outcomes.
The incidence of total venous thrombosis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was 28 (95% CI 12-52, I
Patients with VITT after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination most frequently presented with CVT following DVT/PE and splanchnic vein thrombosis, and about one-third of patients had a fatal outcome. This meta-analysis should provide a better understanding of VITT and assist clinicians in identifying VITT early to improve outcomes and optimise management."
35339338,Severe immune thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna) and immune checkpoint inhibitor.,"Safe and effective prophylactic vaccines are urgently needed to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, several vaccination-related adverse effects have been reported. Here, we report a rare case of severe immune thrombocytopenia occurring 3 days after receiving the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine in an Asian woman with a history of refractory lung adenocarcinoma treated with durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Treatment with platelet transfusion (12 units) and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day) significantly improved her hemoptysis with thrombocytopenia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of ITP following Moderna inoculation among Asians. This study highlights a potential adverse effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors."
35334441,Treatment patterns of thrombopoietin receptor agonists among adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia: A Korean nationwide population-based study.,"Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are a reliable second-line immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) treatment. Despite an increase in use of TPO-RAs, the treatment pattern among adults with ITP is not well understood.
From January 2015 to December 2018, ITP patients were identified using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database.
Of the total 3885 adult patients with ITP, 1745 (44.9%) required treatment, with a median follow-up duration of 31.4 months (range, 0.1-59.8 months). Of these, 46.5% and 36.6% continued treatment for more than 6 months and more than 12 months, respectively. Corticosteroids were the most common first-line therapy. Of the treated patients, 83 (4.8%) received TPO-RAs (eltrombopag, 86.7%; romiplostim, 13.3%). The median age of the group treated with TPO-RAs was 62 years, 62.6% were female, and the median time from first diagnosis to initial TPO-RA treatment was 12.5 months (range, 0.4-48.0 months). A total of 52 (62.7%) patients received TPO-RAs as a second-line treatment for ITP. Splenectomy was performed in 19 patients (22.9%) before initiation of TPO-RAs. When clinical efficacy was analyzed before and during TPO-RA use, there was a significant decrease in platelet transfusion and a tendency toward reduced bleeding events.
This population-based study is the first to describe the treatment pattern of TPO-RAs for ITP among patients in Korea."
35319513,Unusual Presentation of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura in a Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Patient With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in the Setting of MIS-C.,"The understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immune dysregulation is evolving. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease with alternations in both innate and adaptive immunity, probably caused by a complex interplay of genetics and environmental exposure with various triggers. A rare hematological complication of SLE as well as recently reported in an adult with COVID-19 is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We report a pediatric case with features suggestive of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with coronary artery ectasia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and new-onset SLE."
35319506,Rate of Rise of Platelet Count After IVIG for Pediatric Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease causing platelet destruction, and is a common cause of symptomatic thrombocytopenia in children. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is a treatment for ITP that increases the platelet counts of most patients within 24 to 48 hours. This study aimed to calculate the rate of rise in pediatric ITP after a dose of IVIG and to analyze if patient characteristics affected the rate. For 116 children treated for ITP with IVIG at Hershey Medical Center, the rate of rise of the platelet count for all patients was calculated. The rate of rise ranged from -0.1 to +4.2 K/µL/hour (average 1.3, median 1.2). 78% of patients had a rate of rise of over 0.5 K/µL/hour. There was a statistically significant correlation between the rate rise of the platelet count and the initial platelet count (P=0.0197), but rate was not affected by age or sex. This study was able to demonstrate that IVIG is effective in most patients and that demographic features do not affect the rate of rise. By providing a nomogram showing when to expect a meaningful rise in the platelet count after IVIG, we give guidance for timing of the postinfusion platelet count to avoid administering a second dose. Future studies are needed to test this nomogram prospectively."
35319381,COVID-19 Vaccine-Induced Pro-thrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT): State of the Art.,"In 2020, as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly throughout the world, scientists worked relentlessly to develop and test the safety and effectiveness of potential vaccines. Usually, the vaccine development process involves years of investigation and testing prior to gaining approval for use in practice. A pathogenic PF4-dependent syndrome, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, may be manifested following the administration of viral vector vaccines. It leads to severe clot formation at unusual sites approximately in 1 out of 110.000 vaccinated persons. This side effect, although rare, represents a newly devastating clotting phenomenon manifested in otherwise healthy young adults, who are often female. An in-depth description of the specific biological mechanisms implicated in the syndrome is here summarized."
35314552,Severe Immune Thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 Vaccination: Two Case Reports and a Literature Review.,"We herein report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). A 69-year-old Japanese man developed severe thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination. He had oral bleeding and hemoptysis but no thrombotic symptoms. He improved rapidly with oral prednisolone therapy. A 34-year-old Japanese woman had generalized purpura after COVID-19 vaccination. Her platelet count improved rapidly after treatment with prednisolone and eltrombopag. The occurrence of two cases of ITP after COVID-19 vaccination at a single institution suggests that there could be more such undiagnosed cases, especially cases of mild secondary ITP."
35313390,"Real-world, single-center experience of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in immune thrombocytopenia.","Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) relapse following vaccination remains poorly reported in the adult population.
This report details real world data from the largest single-center cohort of ITP relapse following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination.
The vaccination status of 294 patients under active follow-up was reviewed. A total of 17 patients were identified resulting in an incidence of ITP relapse following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in this cohort of 6.6% and an incidence of newly diagnosed ITP following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of 1.4%.
Patients were noted to develop marked deviation of platelet count from baseline following vaccination (P =< .0001). Fourteen patients had a prior diagnosis of ITP and median follow-up following diagnosis was 4 years (range 0-45 years). Days from vaccination to presentation ranged from 2-42 (median 14) and the follow-up period was 34 weeks. Fifteen patients (88%) presented with symptoms and all 17 patients developed symptoms during the follow-up period. Nine patients (53%) received a second dose of vaccine during the follow-up period with seven patients (78%) requiring therapeutic support to facilitate second vaccination. Decision to treat patients was multi-factorial and aimed at decreasing bleeding symptoms and obtaining a platelet count >30 × 10
Vaccination of ITP patients continues to have important clinical benefit; however, recommendations for patients who relapse remain lacking. This report outlines the real-world patient outcomes in the era of widespread SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."
35307758,Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: a rare disease unveiling the diagnosis of EBV-related large B cell lymphoma in a patient with HIV.,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare disease resulting from the overactivation of the immune system due to under regulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. HLH is associated with malignancies, infections, autoimmune disorders and rarely AIDS and is rapidly fatal.
This case report identified a 53 year old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who presented with neutropenic fever of unknown origin. He had two previous hospitalizations prior to the hospitalization diagnosing HLH. The first led to a diagnosis of drug fevers in the setting of treatment for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and subsequent hospitalization led to empiric treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia after workup for intermittent fevers was negative. He was discharged but readmitted 10 days after for recurrence of neutropenic fevers. During this final hospitalization, he was found to have elevated liver enzymes, ferritin, triglycerides and soluble IL-2 receptor with persistent fevers, new splenomegaly and bicytopenia meeting the 2004 HLH criteria. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of HLH as well as EBV associated large B-cell lymphoma. The patient improved on treatment with steroids, rituximab, tocilizumab, and chemotherapy but ultimately passed away due to refractory septic shock from multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
This novel case highlights a patient diagnosed with HLH in the setting of several risk factors for the disease, including AIDS, B-cell lymphoma and EBV. Additionally, this case highlights the importance of early consideration of HLH in the setting of neutropenic fever without clear infectious etiology and search for malignancy associated reasons for HLH especially in immunocompromised patients."
35305536,Cerebral Infarction due to Severe ADAMTS-13 Deficiency with Normal Hematological Parameters: A Cause of Cryptogenic Stroke.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a microangiopathy resulting from an inherited or acquired severe deficiency in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase called ADAMTS-13. Acquired or immune TTP is classically described as a pentad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, fever, renal insufficiency and neurological symptoms. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been linked to stroke with the presence of hematologic abnormalities but whether or not severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency can cause stroke without hematological abnormalities is unknown.
As part of routine clinical care, we identified four cases of recurrent stroke attributed to severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13. We also conducted a search of a centralized electronic health record database including all inpatients and outpatient charts at a single academic medical center over the last ten years in an attempt to identify additional cases.
Here we present four cases of stroke and severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency where stroke episodes occurred without microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or severe thrombocytopenia. These cases show the need to consider severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency in the setting of recurrent cryptogenic stroke in young patients.
TTP directed therapies may be considered for patients with recurrent stroke who have extremely low ADAMTS-13 levels, even when platelet and hemoglobin values are normal."
35305268,Acute drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia - A work of articaine.,"Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) is a rare, but serious complication to a wide range of medications. Upon suspicion, one should do a thorough clinical evaluation following proposed diagnostic criteria and seek laboratory confirmation. If confirmed, it is important to ensure avoidance of the drug in the future.
Herein, we describe a young adult male who experienced two bouts of severe thrombocytopenia following dental treatment. The thrombocytopenia was acknowledged due to unexpected hemorrhaging during the procedures. On both occasions, he was exposed to four different drugs, none commonly associated with DITP. After the second episode of severe procedural-related thrombocytopenia, an investigation into the cause was initiated. We describe the clinical approach to elucidate which of the four implicated drugs was responsible for thrombocytopenia and the laboratory work-up done to confirm that the reaction was antibody-mediated and identify the antibody's drug: glycoprotein specificity. An alternative drug was tested both in vivo and in vitro, to identify an option for future procedures.
Sequential exposure revealed the local anesthetic substance articaine to induce thrombocytopenia. Laboratory work-up confirmed drug-dependent antibodies (DDAbs) with specificity for the glycoprotein Ib/IX complex, swiftly identified by a bead-based Luminex assay. Further investigations by monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens assay (MAIPA) revealed a probable GPIb binding site. An alternative local anesthetic, lidocaine, was deemed safe for future procedures.
Articaine can induce rapid-onset, severe immune-mediated thrombocytopenia causing bleeding complications. A modified bead-based Luminex platelet antigen assay proved a useful addition in the DITP-investigation."

Diagnosis by exclusion and trial-and-error treatment strategies is common practice, and despite the advancement in treatment options, many patients remain refractory. Although the existence of different pathophysiological entities is acknowledged, we are still far from stratifying and understanding ITP. To investigate, we sought to dissect the platelet proteome dynamics in so-called passive and active preclinical ITP mouse models, with which we propose to phenocopy respectively acute/newly diagnosed and persistent/chronic stages of ITP in humans. We obtained the platelet proteome at the thrombocytopenic stage and after platelet count recovery (reached naturally or by IVIg-treatment, depending on the model). Although most of the proteomic alterations were common to both ITP models, there were model-specific protein dynamics that accompanied and explained alterations in platelet aggregation responses, as measured in the passive ITP model. The expression dynamics observed in Syk may explain, extrapolated to humans and pending validation, the increased bleeding tendency of patients with ITP when treated with fostamatinib as third or later- as opposed to second line of treatment. We propose that the platelet proteome may give diagnostic and prognostic insights into ITP and that such studies should be pursued in humans."
35296220,Chronic immune thrombocytopenia in a child with X-linked agammaglobulinemia-an uncommon phenotype.,"Autoimmune disorders are common in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). However, the prevalence of autoimmunity is low in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), mostly due to the absence of antibodies. Chronic or persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which is usually considered an antibody-mediated disease, is uncommon in patients with XLA. In this study, we detailly described a surprising autoimmune phenomenon, chronic ITP, in a small boy diagnosed with XLA. This is an interesting phenotype found in XLA, and it is helpful to understand the immune pathogenesis of autoimmunity in patients with XLA."

35293023,Preliminary evaluation of a flow cytometric assay with microsphere controls for the detection of platelet-bound antibodies in canine immune thrombocytopenia.,"Canine immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) ranges from a mild to severe bleeding disorder, and platelet counts do not reliably predict clinical disease course. The detection of platelet autoantibodies may further define the disease phenotype, but variability in assay configurations and a lack of well-characterized controls limit the diagnostic utility of anti-platelet antibody assays.
We aimed to develop control reagents to facilitate the characterization of canine platelet surface-associated immunoglobulin (PSAIg) in flow cytometric assays.
Silica microspheres were coated with canine IgG and IgM to assess the reactivity of goat and rabbit origin anti-canine immunoglobulin reagents. They were also used as positive controls in the PSAIg assay. Preliminary assay evaluation and determination of sample stability used PRP isolated from seven healthy dogs and 26 dogs newly diagnosed with thrombocytopenia.
Blood sample stability was established for up to a 48-hour storage time. The conjugated positive control microspheres demonstrated stable fluorescent labeling over a 2-year observation period. Rabbit and goat origin anti-dog IgM fluorescent antibody labels reacted nonspecifically with canine IgG. Rabbit origin anti-dog IgG antibody demonstrated greater class specificity for canine IgG than a goat origin antibody. Thrombocytopenic dogs had a broad range of membrane-bound immunoglobulin. Median PSAIgG for dogs with primary or secondary ITP (18.4%, 34.1%, respectively) were significantly higher than controls (3.8%, P < .05).
The described assay reagents and procedures provide positive controls and allow consistent thresholding to define a positive test result, suitable for any flow cytometer. A rabbit anti-dog IgG fluorescent label demonstrated specificity for canine IgG and was useful for the detection of PSAIgG in thrombocytopenic dogs."

A 55-year-old woman presented to us with fever, multiple ischemic strokes, thrombocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, and multiorgan dysfunction a few days after COVID-19 illness. She was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative at admission. MRI showed multiple posterior circulation infarctions. She required intensive treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED), and plasmapheresis for disease remission. Initially, her presentation raised concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, however, many features raised the suspicion of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). Our patient had increased levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and large artery thromboembolism, A positive direct Coomb's test was also more suggestive of immune-mediated hemolysis rather than traction hemolysis, which is the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemia in TTP. Furthermore, MIS-A is known to present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, whereas our case reports predominantly neurological symptoms with relative GI sparing. The overall inflammatory milieu secondary to MIS-A would have contributed to the formation of immune thrombosis, which would have embolized up the vertebrobasilar tree. The MR angiogram did not show any atherosclerotic changes, ruling out an atherosclerotic etiology, which is quite common in posterior circulation infarctions. Multiple courses of immunomodulatory treatment and prolonged treatment with steroids led to disease stabilization."
35289136,A Case Report of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia After ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccination and Heparin Use During Hemodialysis.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but life-threatening complication. VITT strongly mimics heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and shares clinical features. Heparin is commonly used to prevent coagulation during hemodialysis. Therefore, nephrologists might encounter patients needing dialysis with a history of heparin exposure who developed thrombotic thrombocytopenia after vaccination. A 70-year-old male presented with acute kidney injury and altered mental status due to lithium intoxication. He needed consecutive hemodialysis using heparin. Deep vein thrombosis of left lower extremity and accompanying severe thrombocytopenia of 15,000/µL on 24 days after vaccination and at the same time, nine days after heparin use. Anti-platelet factor 4 antibody test was positive. Anticoagulation with apixaban and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion resolved swelling of his left calf and thrombocytopenia. There were no definitive diagnostic tools capable of differentiating between VITT and HIT in this patient. Although VITT and HIT share treatment with IVIG and non-heparin anticoagulation, distinguishing between VITT and HIT will make it possible to establish a follow-up vaccination plan in a person who has had a thrombocytopenic thrombotic event. Further research is needed to develop the tools to make a clear distinction between the clinical syndromes."
35286390,How I manage pregnancy in women with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare inherited platelet function disorder caused by a quantitative and/or qualitative defect of the αIIbβ3 integrin. Pregnancy and delivery are recognized risk periods for bleeding in women with GT. The newborn may also be affected by fetal and neonatal immune thrombocytopenia induced by the transplacental passage of maternal anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies, which can lead to severe hemorrhage and fetal loss. Pregnancy in women with GT thus requires a multidisciplinary approach, including prepregnancy counseling and a treatment plan for delivery for both the mother and child. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge on pregnancy in women with GT and describe how we manage this severe platelet disorder in our clinical practice."

Reactive thrombocytosis has been described as a secondary effect of such therapies. However, the phenomenon of extreme thrombocytosis with morphology mimicking a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) followed by fatal thromboembolism is unusual in this setting. Caution is required in the diagnosis of refractory ITP as well as TPO-receptor agonist dosing in such cases."
35283650,"Is It a Coincidence or Secondary Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura? A Case of an 11-Year-Old Male Patient at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Sidama, Ethiopia.","Isolated thrombocytopenia with normal levels of other cell lines in the absence of other reasons is referred to as ""immune thrombocytopenic purpura"" (ITP). Tuberculosis has been associated with a variety of hematologic abnormalities, although severe thrombocytopenia and tuberculosis presenting as immune thrombocytopenic purpura are extremely uncommon.
We discuss a case of an 11-year-old male adolescent who came with epistaxis and petechial rash lasting one day, as well as severe thrombocytopenia. Following the clinical diagnosis of ITP, the patient was started on prednisone, transfused with platelets, and later started on antituberculosis (ATT) after confirmation of tuberculosis. The patient had a satisfactory response during the course of treatment, and the platelet level was fully recovered after 6 months.
Tuberculosis (TB) should be recognized as a cause of immunological thrombocytopenia in tuberculosis-endemic areas. Our patient's platelet count improved after 1 week of ATT and 2 weeks of prednisolone, and it was entirely restored after 6 months of ATT treatment. Unfortunately, there are no clear guidelines for treating TB-related immune thrombocytopenia or determining the cause of TB-related immune thrombocytopenia. Tuberculosis-induced ITP resolves with the ATT, even though more investigation is warranted."
35283346,Pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts: evaluating accuracy of gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenia purpura diagnoses.,"Given the overlapping clinical indicators and lack of diagnostic testing, misdiagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and gestational thrombocytopenia in pregnancy may be common. Current recommendations suggest utilizing platelet nadir during pregnancy to guide diagnosis.
This study aimed to assess the accuracy of gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnoses using pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts.
This was a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura from January 2017 to December 2019. Platelet counts were extracted from charts and evaluated at several time periods, namely prepregnancy (within 5 years), during pregnancy, and postpartum (>6 weeks to 5 years). A diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia was considered inaccurate if platelet counts were <150,000/µL pre- or postpregnancy with no other apparent causes or if the platelet nadir dropped below 100,000/µL during pregnancy. A diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura was deemed inaccurate if pre- or postpregnancy platelet counts were >150,000/µL. The primary outcome was accuracy of gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnoses in patients. Secondary outcomes included mean platelet counts during pregnancy and difference in mean platelet counts for patients with an accurate vs inaccurate diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia. Outcomes were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared using Student t tests.
A total of 116 patients met the inclusion criteria of which 111 (96%) and 5 (4%) had gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnoses, respectively. Platelet counts outside of pregnancy were available for 91 (82%) of the patients, and 66 (57%) had prepregnancy platelet counts available. Of the 91 patients, the diagnosis was considered accurate in 61 (67%) and 5 (100%) patients with gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura, respectively. Conversely, 30 of 35 (86%) patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura were found to be inaccurately diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia after application of platelet thresholds. Among these 30 patients, 10 had a prepregnancy platelet count <150,000/µL, 12 had a postpartum platelet count <150,000/µL, 3 had a platelet count nadir <100,000/µL during pregnancy, and 7 met more than 1 criterion. Pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts and platelet count nadir differed significantly for patients with an accurate vs inaccurate diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia (P<.001).
When pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts were checked, one-third of cases of gestational thrombocytopenia met the criteria for immune thrombocytopenic purpura and were thus incorrectly diagnosed during pregnancy. Prepregnancy platelet counts, available for most patients, should be considered when diagnosing gestational thrombocytopenia vs immune thrombocytopenic purpura."

ES represents approximately 5% to 10% of all wAIHA and 2%-5% of all ITP cases in adults and its mortality rate is high. When ITP and wAIHA occurred concomitantly, other differential diagnoses must be ruled out. ES can be primary or secondary and isolated or associated with another underlying disorder and secondary ES. The management of ES is mostly empirical with a low level of evidence. This review reports some new insights on this rare disease and provides some practical tools for the diagnosis and management of adult ES."

Eltrombopag is being used after failure of previous lines of therapy with good results at tertiary healthcare centers in Lebanon, a developing country with available multidisciplinary treatment modalities. This is a retrospective multicenter observational study that analyzed data on pediatric patients with chronic or refractory ITP who were given eltrombopag as second- or third-line therapy in 6 large referral hospitals in Beirut (country capital located in mid Lebanon), South, North, and Mount Lebanon between October 2016 and May 2020.

Thrombocytopenia is infrequently observed in APS patients, with an occurrence of 22% to 42% with the frequency of thrombocytopenia, higher in APS and SLE combination than in primary APS. There have been some controversial reports regarding the treatment of APS syndrome with thrombocytopenia with TPO agonists. We like to report a case with APS syndrome with severe thrombocytopenia treated with TPO-RA and developed severe thrombocytosis and thrombosis. Our case represented the first case of TPO-RA in treating APS syndrome developed severe thrombocytosis and our case also concurred that use of TPO-RA agents should be strongly discouraged in APS until larger studies clarify the safety of TPO-RA agents in APS."

We describe the use of cyclosporine (CSA) to prevent recurrence in a patient with iTTP relapse after rituximab therapy, and present a literature review. A 24-year-old woman was diagnosed with iTTP and initially received PEX and high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. However, weekly rituximab therapy was also needed for inhibitor boosting to achieve additional immunosuppression during the initial treatment. Although the patient achieved clinical remission after weekly rituximab therapy, iTTP relapsed twice when glucocorticoids were tapered, and was treated with a triplet regimen consisting of PEX, high-dose methylprednisolone, and weekly rituximab. CSA was administered along with glucocorticoids as prophylaxis against iTTP relapse. The additional CSA therapy successfully maintained iTTP remission and allowed reduction of the corticosteroid dose. Our findings demonstrate that prophylactic CSA can potentially prevent iTTP recurrence in patients with a history of multiple relapses. Data from more cases must be accumulated to establish a useful prophylactic therapy for iTTP that is refractory even to rituximab."
35273612,Immune-Mediated Platelet Activation in COVID-19 and Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia.,"Both qualitative and quantitative platelet abnormalities are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and they correlate with clinical severity and mortality. Activated platelets contribute to the prothrombotic state in COVID-19 patients. Several groups have shown immune-mediated activation of platelets in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune condition characterized by thrombocytopenia and life-threatening thrombotic events in the arterial and venous circulation. Although the initial trigger has yet to be determined, activation of platelets by immune complexes through Fc gamma RIIA results in platelet consumption and thrombosis. A better understanding of platelet activation in COVID-19 as well as in vaccine-induced thrombotic complications will have therapeutic implications. In this review, we focused on the role of immune-mediated platelet activation in thrombotic complications during COVID-19 infection and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia."

Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a rare but life-threatening complication of primarily adenoviral-based vaccines associated with the presence of antibodies to a PF4/polyanion neoepitope and measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Presented are serial anti-PF4/polyanion antibody, platelet, and D-dimer measurements in a large cohort of patients and their relation to relapse. Overall, 51% of patients using the Stago assay had persistently positive anti-PF4/polyanion levels 100 days' postdiagnosis, whereas 94% of patients monitored by using the Immucor assay remain positive. The median duration of positivity of the PF4 assay is 87 days, with 72% of patients remaining positive after a median follow-up of 105 days. The use of plasma exchange seemed to reduce anti-PF4/polyanion levels and increase platelet counts in the acute setting more rapidly than other therapies. The rate of relapse in this study was 12.6%, with all relapsed cases exhibiting persistently positive PF4 antibodies and falling platelet counts. Only one patient had extension of their thrombosis. Overall, despite the persistence of PF4 antibodies in 72% of patients, the rate of relapse was low and did not seem to result in recrudescence of the aggressive clinical picture seen at index presentation. Monitoring of these patients in the UK cohort is ongoing and will aid in definition of the natural history of this novel condition."
35262910,Von Willebrand factor assays in patients with acquired immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura treated with caplacizumab.,"Acquired immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare disease with a poor prognosis if undiagnosed. It is caused by autoantibody production to the von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving protease, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). Caplacizumab, an immunoglobulin directed to the platelet glycoprotein Ibα receptor of VWF, has been reported to induce quicker resolution of iTTP compared to placebo. The laboratory measurement of VWF activity was significantly reduced in clinical trials of caplacizumab. Several VWF assays are available in the UK and this study investigated whether differences in VWF parameters were present in 11 patients diagnosed with iTTP and treated with daily caplacizumab. Chromogenic factor VIII activity, VWF antigen, collagen binding activity, VWF multimers and six VWF activity assays were measured prior to caplacizumab therapy and on several occasions during treatment. VWF antigen and collagen binding activity levels were normal or borderline normal in all patients. Ultra-large molecular weight multimers were present in all patients following treatment. VWF activity assays were normal or reduced during treatment, but this was reagent and patient dependant. In the unusual scenario of a caplacizumab-treated patient requiring measurement of VWF activity, it is important that laboratories understand how their local reagents perform as results cannot be predicted."

0,StatPearls,"C-reactive protein (CRP) was discovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930. The name CRP arose because it was first identified as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the ""c"" carbohydrate antigen of the capsule of pneumococcus. CRP is a pentameric protein synthesized by the liver, whose level rises in response to inflammation. CRP is an acute-phase reactant protein that is primarily induced by the IL-6 action on the gene responsible for the transcription of CRP during the acute phase of an inflammatory/infectious process. There is some question about whether dysregulation of the role of CRP in the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this has not been definitively demonstrated. It has been demonstrated to have some protective properties in animal studies on lung tissue in alveolitis by reducing neutrophil-mediated damage to the alveoli and protein leakage into the lung. CRP has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. It plays a role in the recognition and clearance of foreign pathogens and damaged cells by binding to phosphocholine, phospholipids, histone, chromatin, and fibronectin. It can activate the classic complement pathway and also activate phagocytic cells via Fc receptors to expedite the removal of cellular debris and damaged or apoptotic cells and foreign pathogens. This can become pathologic, however, when it is activated by autoantibodies displaying the phosphocholine arm in auto-immune processes, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). It can also worsen tissue damage in certain cases by activation of the complement system and thus inflammatory cytokines. As compared to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is an indirect test for inflammation, the levels of CRP rise and fall rapidly with the onset and removal of the inflammatory stimulus, respectively. Persistently elevated CRP levels can be seen in chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic infections or inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are numerous causes of an elevated C-reactive protein.  These include acute and chronic conditions, and these can be infectious or non-infectious in etiology. However, markedly elevated levels of CRP are most often associated with an infectious cause (an example of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition).  Trauma can also cause elevations in CRP (alarmin response). More modest elevations tend to be associated with a broader spectrum of etiologies, ranging from sleep disturbances to periodontal disease."

Neonatal lupus erythematosus was first described by Bridge and Foley in 1954 after they observed the transmission of maternal lupus erythematosus factor to newborn infants. The same year, a case of lupus rash in a 6-week old infant was reported, a product of a mother that months later was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. In 1957, a case of an infant with congenital heart disease, whom mother had systemic lupus erythematosus was disclosed. Years later after these first cases were reported, infants with neonatal lupus erythematosus were associated with transient cytopenia and abnormal elevation of aminotransferase."

35235456,A novel mouse strain optimized for chronic human antibody administration.,"Therapeutic human IgG antibodies are routinely tested in mouse models of oncologic, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. However, assessing the efficacy and safety of long-term administration of these agents has been limited by endogenous anti-human IgG immune responses that act to clear human IgG from serum and relevant tissues, thereby reducing their efficacy and contributing to immune complex–mediated pathologies, confounding evaluation of potential toxicity. For this reason, human antibody treatment in mice is generally limited in duration and dosing, thus failing to recapitulate the potential clinical applications of these therapeutics. Here, we report the development of a mouse model that is tolerant of chronic human antibody administration. This model combines both a human IgG1 heavy chain knock-in and a full recapitulation of human Fc receptor (FcγR) expression, providing a unique platform for in vivo testing of human monoclonal antibodies with relevant receptors beyond the short term. Compared to controls, hIgG1 knock-in mice mount minimal anti-human IgG responses, allowing for the persistence of therapeutically active circulating human IgG even in the late stages of treatment in chronic models of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and metastatic melanoma."

35207507,"Pathogenesis of Two Faces of DVT: New Identity of Venous Thromboembolism as Combined Micro-Macrothrombosis via Unifying Mechanism Based on ""Two-Path Unifying Theory"" of Hemostasis and ""Two-Activation Theory of the Endothelium"".","Venous thrombosis includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT), venous thromboembolism (VTE), venous microthrombosis and others. Still, the pathogenesis of each venous thrombosis is not clearly established. Currently, isolated distal DVT and multiple proximal/central DVT are considered to be the same macrothrombotic disease affecting the venous system but with varying degree of clinical expression related to its localization and severity. The genesis of two phenotypes of DVT differing in clinical features and prognostic outcome can be identified by their unique hemostatic mechanisms. Two recently proposed hemostatic theories in vivo have clearly defined the character between ""microthrombi"" and ""macrothrombus"" in the vascular system. Phenotypic expression of thrombosis depends upon two major variables: (1) depth of vascular wall damage and (2) extent of the injury affecting the vascular tree system. Vascular wall injury limited to endothelial cells (ECs) in sepsis produces ""disseminated"" microthrombi, but intravascular injury due to trauma extending from ECs to subendothelial tissue (SET) produces ""local"" macrothrombus. Pathogen-induced sepsis activates the complement system leading to generalized endotheliopathy, which releases ultra large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers from ECs and promotes ULVWF path of hemostasis. In the venous system, the activated ULVWF path initiates microthrombogenesis to form platelet-ULVWF complexes, which become ""microthrombi strings"" that produce venous endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (vEA-VMTD) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)-like syndrome. In the arterial system, endotheliopathy produces arterial EA-VMTD (aEA-VMTD) with ""life-threatening"" thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome. Typically, vEA-VMTD is ""silent"" unless complicated by additional local venous vascular injury. A local venous vessel trauma without sepsis produces localized macrothrombosis due to activated ULVWF and tissue factor (TF) paths from damaged ECs and SET, which causes distal DVT with good prognosis. However, if a septic patient with ""silent"" vEA-VMTD is complicated by additional vascular injury from in-hospital vascular accesses, ""venous combined micro-macrothrombosis"" may develop as VTE via the unifying mechanism of the ""two-path unifying theory"" of hemostasis. This paradigm shifting pathogenetic difference between distal DVT and proximal/central DVT calls for a reassessment of current therapeutic approaches."
35202800,Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 and after COVID-19 vaccination.,"Thrombosis that occurs in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a serious complication and a critical aspect of pathogenesis in the disease progression. Although thrombocytopenia is uncommon in the initial presentation, it may also reflect disease severity due to the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to activate platelets. This occurs directly through the spike protein-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction and indirectly by coagulation and inflammation activation. Dysregulation in both innate and adaptive immune systems is another critical factor that causes thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in COVID-19. Vaccination is the most potent and effective tool to mitigate COVID-19; however, rare side effects, namely vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)/thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) can occur following adenovirus-vectored vaccine administration. VITT/TTS is rare, and thrombocytopenia can be the clue to detect this serious complication. It is important to consider that thrombocytopenia and/or thromboembolism are not events limited to post-vaccination with vectored vaccine, but are also seen rarely after vaccination with other vaccines. Various conditions mimic VITT/TTS, and it is vital to achieving the correct diagnosis at an earlier stage. Antiplatelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody detection by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used for diagnosing VITT/TTS. However, false-positive rates also occur in vaccinated people, who do not show any thrombosis or thrombocytopenia. Vaccinated people with messenger RNA vaccine can show positive but low density and non-functional in terms of platelet aggregation, it is vital to check the optical density. If anti-PF4 ELISA is not available, discriminating other conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hemophagocytic syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is critical when the patients show thrombosis with thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination."
35201417,Refractory primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP): current clinical challenges and therapeutic perspectives.,"Chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can today benefit from multiple therapeutic approaches with proven clinical efficacy, including rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA), and splenectomy. However, some ITP patients are unresponsive to multiple lines of therapy with prolonged and severe thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of refractory ITP is mainly performed by exclusion of other disorders and is based on the clinician's expertise. However, it significantly increases the risk of drug-related toxicity and of bleedings, including life-threatening events. The management of refractory ITP remains a major clinical challenge. Here, we provide an overview of the currently available treatment options, and we discuss the emerging rationale of new therapeutic approaches and their strategic combination. Particularly, combination strategies may target multiple pathogenetic mechanisms and trigger additive or synergistic effects. A series of best practices arising both from published studies and from real-life clinical experience is also included, aiming to optimize the management of refractory ITP."
35201292,Clinical care pathway for the evaluation of patients with suspected VITT after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) adenoviral vector vaccination. In British Columbia (BC), Canada, a provincial clinical care pathway was developed to guide clinicians in evaluating for VITT among patients who present with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis symptoms within 4 to 28 days after adenoviral vector vaccine exposure. All patients had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing for platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies, and all cases with positive PF4-ELISA or d-dimer levels ≥2.0 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) had further testing for platelet-activating PF4 antibodies using a modified serotonin release assay (SRA). Between 1 May and 30 June 2021, 37% of 68 patients investigated for VITT had thrombosis, but only 3 had VITT confirmed by PF4-ELISA and SRA. Platelet counts, d-dimer levels, and ELISA optical density values were significantly different between those with and without VITT. Three patients had thrombocytopenia and thrombosis with d-dimer levels >4.0 mg/L FEU but had negative PF4-ELISA and SRA results. Patients with VITT were treated successfully with IV immunoglobulin, nonheparin anticoagulants, and corticosteroids. Our pathway demonstrated that thrombosis is common among patients investigated for VITT and that PF4-ELISA testing is necessary to confirm VITT in those presenting with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia."

The authors report a case of severe, early-onset thrombocytopenia with mucocutaneous bleeding in an otherwise well-appearing full-term neonate. Recurrence of thrombocytopenia following initial treatment and its persistence after 2 weeks of life suggested a dual immune mechanism. This is a rare case of immune thrombocytopenia caused by human platelet antigen-5b alloimmunization and passive transfer of maternal antiplatelet antibodies. Appropriate, timely treatment and absence of severe bleeding complications, namely intracranial hemorrhage, conferred a good overall prognosis."
35199503,Antiplatelet antibody predicts platelet desialylation and apoptosis in immune thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder caused by dysregulated B- and T- cell functions, which lead to platelet destruction. A well-recognized mechanism of ITP pathogenesis involves anti-platelet and anti-megakaryocyte antibodies recognizing membrane glycoprotein (GP) complexes, mainly GPIb/IX and GPIIb/IIIa. In addition to the current view of phagocytosis of the opsonised platelets by splenic and hepatic macrophages via their Fc γ receptors, antibodyinduced platelet desialylation and apoptosis have also been reported to contribute to ITP pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the relationship between the specific thrombocytopenic mechanisms and various types of anti-platelet antibodies has not been established. In order to ascertain such association, we used sera from 61 ITP patients and assessed the capacity of anti-platelet antibodies to induce neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) surface expression, RCA-1 lectin binding and loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential on donors' platelets. Sera from ITP patients with detectable antibodies caused significant platelet desialylation and apoptosis. Anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies appeared more capable of causing NEU1 surface translocation while anti-GPIb/IX complex antibodies resulted in a higher degree of platelet apoptosis. In ITP patients with anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, both desialylation and apoptosis were dependent on FcγRIIa signaling rather than platelet activation. Finally, we confirmed in a murine model of ITP that destruction of human platelets induced by anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies can be prevented with the NEU1 inhibitor oseltamivir. A collaborative clinical trial is warranted to investigate the utility of oseltamivir in the treatment of ITP."
35196955,New presentations and exacerbations of immune thrombocytopenia after coronavirus disease 2019 vaccinations: the Taiwan experience.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a condition that is distinct from thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) that may also occur after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations. Previous reports revealed an increased ITP incidence after ChAdOx1, a vaccine for COVID-19. Our study aimed to highlight the key features of ITP after COVID-19 vaccination. From April to October 2021, we collected data on 23 patients, including nine men and 14 women, with ITP from five hospitals across Taiwan who received either the ChAdOx1 or mRNA-1273 vaccine before development or exacerbation of ITP. Our findings revealed that both ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were associated with ITP. Many patients responded well to steroids and immune suppressants, which may also suggest that the nature of thrombocytopenia is more like ITP rather than TTS. Lack of thrombosis, low D-dimer level, and negative anti-PF4 result could help to exclude TTS, which is also a rare but a far more lethal condition."

Immune-mediated TTP develops due to autoantibodies against ADAMTS-13, whereas congenital TTP is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Diagnostic possibilities and treatment options in TTP have emerged in recent years, which prompted the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) to publish clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of TTP in 2020. In this article, the European Renal Best Practice Working Group endorsed the ISTH guidelines and emphasizes a number of considerations, including the importance of rapid ADAMTS-13 activity testing, the use of rituximab and anti-von Willebrand factor therapies such as caplacizumab, that enhance the clinical applicability of the guidelines in Europe."

To compare current practice in the United Kingdom (UK) against the standards set out in the 2012 British Society of Haematology guideline, and to better understand the issues affecting prompt initiation of PEX.
The trainee research network HaemSTAR conducted a retrospective nationwide review of adults presenting to UK hospitals with a first episode of acute TTP.
Data on 148 patients treated at 80 UK hospitals between 2014 and 2019 demonstrated that 64.8% of patients received PEX within 24 h. Diagnostic uncertainty was the most commonly cited reason for delayed treatment. Conversely, a shorter time to PEX occurred in patients who had red cell fragments or severe thrombocytopenia identified on their first complete blood count. Availability of on-site PEX was associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving PEX within 8 h compared to patients transferred, but by 24 h there was no difference between the two groups and two-thirds of all patients had received their first PEX. The mortality rate for patients that received PEX was 9.2%, with 27.8% of deaths linked to delayed treatment initiation.
This is the first multi-center evaluation of treatment delays in acute TTP and it will inform targeted pathways to improve prompt access to life-saving intervention."

35186538,Severe Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Following Influenza Vaccination: A Case Report.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare, acquired bleeding disorder caused by various underlying etiologies. ITP can be triggered by medication, infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. One of the rare triggers is vaccination. As in many cases, the symptoms are mild and the cause is idiopathic, and it may not be diagnosed without extensive investigations. It can also be difficult to differentiate between medication-induced thrombocytopenia and ITP, particularly in older patients with multiple comorbidities and receiving multiple medications. Here, we describe an older patient with acute onset ITP following influenza vaccination. An 88-year-old man presented with complaints of systemic itchiness and bleeding from his mouth. Four days prior to the symptoms appearing, he had received an influenza vaccine and did not experience any severe pain or anaphylactic symptoms. On presentation, he had multiple bleeding blisters and systemic petechiae. Blood tests revealed a platelet count of 1000/µL. A month prior, his platelet count was 1.5×10"
35185060,Anti-GPIHBP1 Antibody-Positive Autoimmune Hyperchylomicronemia and Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Primary hyperchylomicronemia is characterized by marked hypertriglyceridemia exceeding 1,000 mg/dL. It is caused by dysfunctional mutations in specific genes, namely those for lipoprotein lipase (LPL), glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), apolipoprotein C2 (ApoC-II), lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1), or apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA-V). Importantly, antibodies against LPL or GPIHBP1 have also been reported to induce autoimmune hyperchylomicronemia. The patient was a 46-year-old man diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) at 41 years. At the time, he was administered prednisolone (PSL) and eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. At 44 years, he suffered from acute myocardial infarction, and PSL was discontinued to avoid enhancing atherogenic risks. He was maintained on eltrombopag monotherapy. After discontinuing PSL, marked hypertriglyceridemia (＞3,000 mg/dL) was observed, which did not improve even after a few years of pemafibrate therapy. Upon referral to our clinic, the triglyceride (TG) level was 2,251 mg/dL, ApoC-II was 19.8 mg/dL, LPL was 11.1 ng/mL (0.02-1.5 ng/mL), GPIHBP1 was 47.7 pg/mL (740.0-1,014.0 pg/mL), and anti-GPIHBP1 antibody was detected. The patient was diagnosed to have anti-GPIHBP1 antibody-positive autoimmune hyperchylomicronemia. He was administered PSL 15 mg/day, and TG levels were controlled at approximately 200 mg/dL. Recent studies have reported that patients with anti-GPIHBP1 antibody-induced autoimmune hyperchylomicronemia had concomitant rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's disease, and Graves' disease. We report a rare case of anti-GPIHBP1 antibody-positive autoimmune hyperchylomicronemia with concomitant ITP, which became apparent when PSL was discontinued due to the onset of steroid-induced acute myocardial infarction."

Limited data are available describing outcomes in patients who switched from romiplostim or eltrombopag to avatrombopag, a newer oral TPO-RA. We performed a retrospective observational study of adults with ITP who switched from eltrombopag or romiplostim to avatrombopag at four US tertiary ITP referral centres.

Flow cytometry can be used to further characterize the B- and T-cell compartments involved in platelet destruction. This case-control study was to enumerate plasmablast cells in pediatric ITP patients and to correlate their levels with disease course. This study included 30 ITP patients and 10 controls. Identification and enumeration of Plasmablast were done by multicolor flow cytometry using specific antibody panels (CD19, CD27 & CD38) and sequential gating using FACSCanto flow cytometer and FlowJo software.

Here, we present a case of a 28-year-old woman who received the tozinameran (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNtech) vaccine for COVID-19 and experienced an iTTP relapse during longitudinal follow-up. She received the vaccine 30 months after her initial diagnosis, while she was in clinical remission. She was not in complete ADAMTS-13 remission, as she had undetectable ADAMTS-13 activity during follow-up except for one isolated measurement of 48%. Shortly after vaccination, she developed complaints of bruising, petechiae, ataxia, and an episode of slurred speech. Laboratory testing demonstrated thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, and eventually undetectable ADAMTS-13 activity. She was successfully treated with caplacizumab, rituximab, and corticosteroids without plasma exchange. She achieved complete clinical and ADAMTS-13 remission after treatment. We recommend caution in the administration of COVID-19 vaccines for survivors of iTTP in remission with severely deficient ADAMTS-13 activity."
35149911,Comparative efficacy of 19 drug therapies for patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a multiple-treatments network meta-analysis.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common clinical bleeding disorder with a high mortality rate and poor long-term survival quality in severe patients. There is controversy on how to choose the appropriate treatment. We systematically reviewed 19 randomized controlled trials (including 2615 participants) from January 1, 2015, to April 20, 2021. These investigations compared multiple drugs or their combinations in the therapeutic dose range for the treatment of ITP. The primary endpoint was based on the proportion of patients who responded to these therapies. The efficacy of eltrombopag plus rituximab, avatrombopag, dexamethasone plus anti-HP, and dexamethasone plus rhTPO was significantly higher than placebo (OR: 46.66, 29.44, 2.66, 1.86) or dexamethasone alone (OR: 46.22, 29.01, 2.22, 1.40). Placebo, oral immunosuppressants, and dexamethasone plus oseltamivir were less effective than the other ITP therapies tested. Eltrombopag plus rituximab may be the best choice when starting treatment for ITP."
35147241,Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia.,"Major options for second-line therapy in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) include splenectomy, rituximab, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TRAs). The American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend rituximab over splenectomy, TRAs over rituximab, and splenectomy or TRAs while noting a lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these therapies. Using prospective, observational, and meta-analytic data, we performed the first cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line therapies in chronic ITP, from the perspective of the U.S. health system. Over a 20-year time-horizon, our six-strategy Markov model shows that a strategy incorporating early splenectomy, an approach at odds with current guidelines and clinical practice, is the cost-effective strategy. All four strategies utilizing TRAs in the first or second position cost over $1 million per quality-adjusted life-year, as compared to strategies involving early use of splenectomy and rituximab. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, early use of splenectomy and rituximab in either order was favored in 100% of 10 000 iterations. The annual cost of TRAs would have to decrease over 80% to begin to become cost-effective in any early TRA strategy. Our data indicate that effectiveness of early TRA and late TRA strategies is similar with the cost significantly greater with early TRA strategies. Contrary to current practice trends and guidelines, early use of splenectomy and rituximab, rather than TRAs, constitutes cost-effective treatment in adults with chronic ITP."

Claims-based retrospective cohort study of incidence.
US commercial health insurance administrative claims database.
Adults 25-64 years of age between 2015 and 2019 with a minimum of 12 consecutive thrombosis-free months of continuous enrolment beginning 2014 were selected.
Age (10-year intervals) and sex stratum-specific incidence rates per 100 000 person-years were determined for venous thromboembolism (VTE), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and other major venous thrombotic events, and events of special interest, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), haemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Of 13 249 229 enrollees (half female/male), incidence of venous thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), CVT or other major venous thrombotic conditions) was 247.89 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 245.96 to 249.84). Incidence of VTE was 213.79 with ICD codes alone (95% CI: 211.99 to 215.59) and 129.34 (95% CI: 127.95 to 130.75) when also requiring a filled anticoagulation prescription or an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Incidence was 6.37 for CVT (95% CI: 6.07 to 6.69), 26.06 for ITP (95% CI: 25.44 to 26.78), 0.94 for HUS (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.06) and 4.82 for HIT (95% CI: 4.56 to 5.10). The co-occurrence of CVT with either ITP or HIT (diagnoses within 14 days of one another) was 0.090 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.13). Incidence tended to increase with age and was higher for women under 55. Incidence for CVT, HUS and CVT with ITP or HIT was higher for women in all age groups. Incidence of PE and CVT increased significantly over the 5-year period, while DVT rates decreased.

35137341,Changing profile of platelet activity and turnover indices during treatment response of immune thrombocytopenia.,"Both platelet count and function change after treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Platelet function can be measured by plasma markers, including platelet activity [e.g., soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L)] and platelet turnover markers [e.g., glycocalicin (GC)]. Patients were classified into no response (NR, including new diagnosis), partial response (PR) and complete response (CR). One hundred and sixteen samples (29 CR, 32 PR, 55 NR) from 79 patients were collected. Plasma markers (sP-selectin, sCD40L and GC) were measured by ELISA. Platelet counts and mean platelet volume (MPV) were obtained in the clinical laboratory using GenS System-2. The results showed that responsive patients (PR + CR) had higher levels of sP-selectin (P = 0.026) and sCD40L (P = 0.001). Although there was no difference in MPV (P = 0.077) or GC (P = 0.078), there was a marked decrease of GC index (P < 0.001) in responsive patients. Paired sample analysis showed no difference in sP-selectin, sCD40L, MPV or GC but significant difference in GC index (P = 0.017) between NR and PR. Another paired sample analysis showed no difference in sP-selectin, sCD40L, MPV or GC but significant difference in GC index (P = 0.029) between PR and CR. Patients with refractory and newly diagnosed disease had a significant difference in GC (P = 0.020) and sCD40L (P = 0.001), despite similarly low platelet counts. In conclusion, platelet activity markers (sP-selectin and sCD40L) and GC indices change in parallel with treatment response. Plasma levels of GC and sCD40L may be predictors of treatment response."

35132908,"Refractory immune thrombocytopenia successfully treated with bortezomib in a child with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, complicated by Evans syndrome and hypogammaglobulinemia.","Treatment of refractory autoimmune cytopenias (AICs) and Evans syndrome (ES) represent a great challenge in pediatric setting, where an underlying primary immunodeficiency is recurrent. Frequently, second or third line treatments are employed, with an increased risk of toxicity and infections. The advent of novel drugs is the object of research in order to modify the management of these patients.We report a case of successful use of bortezomib in a child with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and CVID-like phenotype with a multi-refractory severe ES. Last flares were prolonged and dominated by severe and symptomatic ITP, refractory to different courses of high dose steroid and IVIG, mofetil mycophenolate, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, sirolimus, and rituximab. Persistence of AICs in subjects with depletion of CD20 + B-cells and IgG strengthens the hypothesis about the production of autoantibodies by terminally differentiated plasma-cells, not targetable from immunosuppressants and rituximab.In the attempt to enhance plasma-cells inhibition, the child was addressed to bortezomib, with a good response at 6 month follow-up without side effects. Nowadays, the use of bortezomib in ES/AICs is based only on small retrospective studies and case reports. Despite the lack of long term follow-up, our work highlights the potential role of bortezomib in the management of pediatric patients with multi-resistant AICs secondary to immune-system impairment."

The molecular basis for the variable response has not yet been fully elucidated. This study was designed to address the predictive value of regulatory B-cell (B reg ) count and interleukin-10 (IL-10) serum levels for acute ITP patients who progress to chronic phase. The present study included 80 children with acute ITP )38 males and 42 females (with median age of 8 years and 40 matched healthy controls. Assessment of B reg (CD19 + CD24 hi CD38 hi ) was carried out by a multicolor flowcytometry, however, IL-10 serum levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A significant reduction of B reg percentage and a significant increase in serum IL-10 levels were identified in children with acute ITP as compared with controls ( P <0.001 for both). Fourteen ITP patients passed to chronic phase, while 66 patients achieved remission within 6 months. The absolute B reg was significantly lower, while IL-10 was significantly higher in patients with acute ITP who progressed to chronic phase in comparison with acute ITP patients who achieved complete remission. Cox proportional hazards for ITP chronicity revealed that IL-10 OR was 2.46 (confidence interval: 1.42-4.27; P =0.001) and absolute B reg OR was 0.147 (confidence interval: 0.128-0.624; P =0.005) in the peripheral blood. Therefore, they could predict chronicity in ITP cases.
Reduced B reg count and elevated IL-10 levels in patients with acute ITP at diagnosis can predict chronicity."

Limited availability of pharmacokinetic (PK) data and large inter- and intra-subject variability in PK and platelet response is a challenge in the clinical development of a romiplostim biosimilar. We compared pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD)/efficacy, and safety of a romiplostim biosimilar with Nplate in 24 patients with ITP following a single 3 μg/kg dose, and assessed efficacy of the romiplostim biosimilar at a titrated dose range of 1-5 μg/kg in 50 patients with ITP. The PK of the romiplostim biosimilar did not differ compared to the PK of Nplate, and PD/efficacy responses were similar between the products following the single dose. The romiplostim biosimilar showed historically comparable PD/efficacy with Nplate over 8 weeks when treated at the titrated dose range. It was well tolerated in both the studies.

35123634,[Relationship between the Expression of miRNA181a-5p and the Imbalance of Treg/Th17 in Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia].,"To investigate the role of relationship between the expression of miRNA181a-5p and imbalance of Treg/Th17 in the pathogenesis of primary immune thrombocytopenia(ITP), which contributes to clarify the mechanism of T cell immune imbalance in ITP patients.
Peripheral blood was collected from 37 ITP patients, concluding 21 untreated patients and 16 effectively treated patients, and 19 healthy controls; Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and the expression of miRNA181a-5p and Notch1 was analyzed by RT-PCR. The proportion of Th17 subsets and Treg cells in the peripheral circulation was detected by flow cytometer (FCM). Clinical data of ITP group was collected, including age, platelet count and disease course.
The expression of miR-181a-5p was significantly decreased in ITP group than that of healthy control group (P＜0.01). After effective treatment, the expression of miR-181a-5p was significantly higher than that of ITP group (P＜0.05), but still significantly lower than that of healthy control group (P＜0.01); The expression of Notch1 was significantly increased in ITP group and effectively treated group than that of healthy control group (P＜0.01). There was no significant difference in proportion of Treg cells in ITP group, effectively treated group and healthy control group (P＞0.05). The proportion of Th17 subsets in ITP group was significantly increased than that of healthy control group (P＜0.05), while the ratio of Treg/Th17 was significantly decreased (P＜0.05). There was a positive correlation between the expression of miR-181a-5p and ratio of Treg/Th17 in ITP group (r=0.555).
The expression of miR-181a-5p is significantly decreased in ITP patients, which is closely related to the imbalance of Treg/Th17 cells. After effective treatment, the expression of miR-181a-5p can be significantly corrected, but still failed to reach the level of healthy people. While the expression of Notch1 is significantly increased in ITP patients, and could not reach the level of healthy people after effective treatment.

The patient was referred to our hospital because of progressive nasal congestion and nasal mass. Nasopharyngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed. The biopsy pathological hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining indicated plasma cell myeloma, and further immunohistochemistry CD99(+), CD79a(+), CD38(+), MUM-1(+), and Lambda(+) confirmed the diagnosis. The patient's bone marrow was normal, and hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, evident bone lesions were not observed. Serum immunoglobulin quantification, serum protein electrophoresis, and blood and urine light chain quantification were all within the normal range. The serum immunofixation electrophoresis was negative, and the serum-free light chain was normal. These results could rule out multiple myeloma (MM) and prove to be EMP involving the nasal cavity, main bronchus, lung, and left hip. No desired effect was achieved after receiving PAD (bortezomib, adriamycin, and dexamethasone) and VRD (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) treatments. Even if the tumor was remarkably relieved after receiving the 2-course CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen, secondary resistance to CHOP unfortunately occurred in this case. We attempted to apply epigenetic therapy in the treatment of refractory multiple EMP. Although no complete remission (CR) was achieved, the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) in tumor lesions was significantly lower than before, and the patient's symptoms significantly improved. The patient tolerated decitabine and chidamide. We speculated that epigenetic drugs have potential effect in the treatment of multiple-site EMP."

Therefore, we evaluated HRQoL with the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) in an internal cohort of 69 chronic ITP patients, overall and by type of treatment. Of these patients, 26 patients were splenectomized, while other patients were treated medically with thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) or immunosuppressive treatment. We also compared HRQoL of the splenectomized patients (internal cohort) with an external cohort of 63 splenectomized ITP patients and the general population. The median follow-up was 10 years (range 1-20). Splenectomized patients had a worse overall HRQoL profile than those who received medical therapy either with TPO-RAs or other treatments (OT), with clinically meaningful differences registered in several domains. These included physical functioning (Δ = - 17.0 and Δ = - 15.2, for TPO-Ras and OT, respectively, p = 0.065), role physical (Δ = - 9.7 and Δ = - 13.8, p = 0.483), and bodily pain (Δ = - 14.2 and Δ = - 18.8, p = 0.053). Compared to the general population, both internal and external splenectomized cohorts had an impaired HRQoL profile. Further studies on HRQoL in splenectomized ITP patients are needed to better understand the long-term impact of this surgical procedure."

35074629,Recent advances in the mechanisms and treatment of immune thrombocytopenia.,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease associated with a reduced peripheral blood platelet count. The phenotype is variable with some patients suffering no bleeding whilst others have severe bleeding which may be fatal. Variability in clinical behaviour and treatment responses reflects its complex underlying pathophysiology. Historically the management has relied heavily on immune suppression. Recent studies have shown that the older empirical immune suppressants fail to alter the natural history of the disease and are associated with a poor quality of life for patients. Newer treatments, such as the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, have transformed ITP care. They have high efficacy, are well tolerated and improve patients' quality of life. A greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder has helped develop a number of new targeted therapies. These include inhibitors of the neonatal Fc receptor inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase and complement pathway. Here we discuss the mechanisms underlying ITP and the new approach to ITP care."

Dose adjustments of romiplostim are based on platelet counts and follow a dosing schema that requires frequent monitoring. As a quality improvement initiative to increase clinical efficiency and promote clinical pharmacy services at our institution, we developed a collaborative practice agreement and implemented a novel pharmacist-driven romiplostim dosing protocol.
A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the acceptance, utilization, and impact of the pharmacist-driven romiplostim dosing service. The primary outcome of our analysis was the adoption rate by providers of the romiplostim pharmacist dosing service. Secondary endpoints were focused on patients newly initiating romiplostim on the dosing service and included platelet responses and number of dose adjustments by a pharmacist.
A total of 54 patients received romiplostim in our analysis: 25 patients who had already been receiving romiplostim and 29 patients who newly initiated romiplostim during the study period. Of the 29 patients newly initiating romiplostim, 27 (93%) had their dosing managed by a pharmacist Twenty-one patients (84%) and 18 patients (75%) achieved an initial and durable response with romiplostim, respectively. Pharmacists made a median of 3 dose adjustments to romiplostim per patient.
The implementation of a pharmacist-driven romiplostim dosing service led to a significant adoption and utilization by physicians at our health system."

Patients with VITT are characterized by a variable clinical presentation, likewise also the outcome of these patients is very variable. Here we report the lung ultrastructural findings in the course of VITT of a 58-year-old male patient. Alveoli were mainly dilated, irregular in shape, and occupied by a reticular network of fibrin, while interalveolar septa appeared thickened. The proliferation of small capillaries gave rise to plexiform structures and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis-like features. Near the alveoli occupied by a dense fibrin network, the medium-sized arteries showed a modified wall and an intraluminal thrombus. This scenario looks quite similar to that found during COVID-19, where the lungs suffer from the attack of the antigen-antibodies complexes and the virus respectively. In both diseases, the final outcome is a severe inflammation, activation of the haemostatic system and fibrinolysis."

In this study, we determine whether preplatelets and/or barbells are equivalent to reticulated/immature platelets by using ImageStream flow cytometry and super-resolution microscopy. Immature platelets, preplatelets, and barbells were quantified in healthy and thrombocytopenic mice, healthy human volunteers, and patients with immune thrombocytopenia or undergoing chemotherapy. Preplatelets and barbells were 1.9% ± 0.18%/1.7% ± 0.48% (n = 6) and 3.3% ± 1.6%/0.5% ± 0.27% (n = 12) of total platelet counts in murine and human whole blood, respectively. Both preplatelets and barbells exhibited high expression of major histocompatibility complex class I with high thiazole orange and Mitotracker fluorescence. Tracking dye experiments confirmed that preplatelets transform into barbells and undergo fission ex vivo to increase platelet counts, with dependence on the cytoskeleton and normal mitochondrial respiration. Samples from antibody-induced thrombocytopenia in mice and patients with immune thrombocytopenia had increased levels of both preplatelets and barbells correlating with immature platelet levels. Furthermore, barbells were absent after chemotherapy in patients. In mice, in vivo biotinylation confirmed that barbells, but not all large platelets, were immature. This study demonstrates that a subpopulation of large platelets are immature preplatelets that can transform into barbells and undergo fission during maturation."
35037230,Autoimmune-mediated thrombocytopenia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: significance of detecting reticulated platelets and glycoprotein-specific platelet autoantibodies.,"Autoimmune hematological disorders are rare complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is challenging, especially after allo-HSCT, because various complications such as graft-versus-host disease, disease relapse, viral infection, thrombotic microangiopathy, and drug side effects can also cause thrombocytopenia. Assessment of reticulated platelets (RP) and plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) levels may be useful to distinguish between ITP and hypoplastic thrombocytopenia. ITP is generally characterized by an increased percentage of RP, and a normal or slightly increased plasma TPO level. We now report three cases of thrombocytopenia after allo-HSCT. RP% was elevated in these patients, as it is in primary ITP. However, in contrast to primary ITP, plasma TPO levels were high in two of three patients. Anti-αIIbβ3 and anti-GPIb/IX-specific direct IgG antibodies were detected as well, suggesting occurrence of immune-mediated platelet destruction in addition to bone marrow suppression in two patients. All three patients were successfully treated with corticosteroids and/or thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs). These results suggest that increased RP% and detection of glycoprotein-specific platelet autoantibodies are useful for the diagnosis of ITP after HSCT."

There are few reports about treatment of refractory thrombocytopenic purpura in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We report a case of refractory ITP in which changes in platelet-related markers with therapeutic agents are worthy of the attention of clinicians.
A 69-year-old woman admitted for ecchymosis on the neck and arms for 15 days presented to our hospital. She was diagnosed with RA 5 years ago.
The diagnosis met the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classification criteria. The disease activity score 28 (DAS-28) was 4.6, indicating that the disease activity was moderate.
Treatment with first-line therapies and second-line treatment--eltrombopag (EPAG) were ineffective. Therefore, we performed rituximab combined with a low dose of EPAG.
The patient received 2 cycles of rituximab combined with EPAG, and reported no new petechiae on her buccal mucosa and limbs during follow-up.
This case suggests that early treatment of rituximab combined with EPAG is beneficial to patients with refractory ITP in RA. In terms of disease dynamic monitoring, immature platelet fraction (IPF) may be an auxiliary indicator for predicting efficacy, but its significance needs further study."
35028970,Risk factors for severe neonatal thrombocytopenia in cases of maternal immune thrombocytopenia.,"Maternal immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may induce neonatal thrombocytopenia (nTP), which carries a risk of neonatal haemorrhagic complications. Some risk factors for nTP have reached consensus such as maternal splenectomy and previous severe nTP, while others such as maternal platelet count have not.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital, including 145 neonates of mothers with ITP. We assessed the risk of severe nTP and bleeding complications.
Severe nTP in the first 24 h after birth was more common in case of maternal splenectomy (OR = 4.4) and a previous severe nTP (OR = 46.9). Severe nTP at nadir (lowest platelet count during the initial postnatal days) was more frequent in cases of a previous neonate with severe nTP (OR = 42), maternal treatment during pregnancy (OR = 2.4) and a low maternal platelet count during pregnancy or at delivery. These risk factors were not significantly associated with an increased risk of neonatal haemorrhagic complications.
In our population, we confirm the risk of severe nTP in case of maternal splenectomy or previous nTP. By monitoring the platelet count to its nadir, we identified three additional risk factors: maternal treatment during pregnancy and low maternal platelet count during pregnancy or low maternal platelet count at delivery."
35028233,Hyperhemolysis in the Setting of Mixed-Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: A Rare Complication of COVID-19.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human pathogen known for its predilection on the respiratory system. Herein, we present a unique case in which a patient developed hyperhemolysis in the setting of mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) secondary to SARS-CoV-2. A 33-years-old male with a past medical history of resolved immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) presented to the hospital with symptoms of jaundice after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. On admission, his Hgb was 12.5 g/dL. Lab results showed indirect bilirubin of 13 mg/dL, LDH at 759 U/L, haptoglobin <10, and the percent reticulocyte count was 2.33%. A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was also positive for C3, IgG, anti-E, in addition to both warm and cold autoantibodies. PCR was positive for COVID-19. Within two days of admission, his Hgb dropped to 5.9 g/dL. A total of seven units of packed red blood cell (pRBC) was required to achieve a Hgb of 6 g/dL in 48 hours. Patients with preexisting hematological abnormalities have a propensity to develop AIHA in the setting of the virus. The majority of the cases described in the literature were associated with warm AIHA. Our patient tested positive for both warm and cold antibodies, which may partially explain the mechanism behind hyperhemolysis in our patient."
35026658,Clinical utility of the CD10+/HLA-DR+ population in bone marrow mononuclear cells from adults with immune thrombocytopenia.,"Several patients with immune thrombocytopenia show good clinical courses without any major complications. However, severe bleeding complications, such as hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhages, are occasionally observed in some patients associated with marked thrombocytopenia; this results in 1.5-fold higher mortality for such patients compared with the general population. We report here the cases of two patients with immune thrombocytopenia whose bone marrow included a prominent cluster of differentiation (CD)10+/ human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ population and showed good response to steroid therapy. Conversely, two other patients without a CD10+/HLA-DR+ population were refractory to steroids, and one of them had a serious course. Retrospective examination of 30 patients with severe immune thrombocytopenia revealed that they had a higher percentage of CD10+/HLA-DR+ cells compared with patients with other benign hematological diseases. As differential diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia with severe thrombocytopenia is often difficult, it may be helpful to understand whether CD10+/HLA-DR+ cells are increased. We also show the possible correlation of resistance to steroid therapy and lower percentages of CD10+/HLA-DR+ cells. It has been reported that nonresponsiveness to steroid treatment was a high risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage. Lower percentages of CD10+/HLA-DR+ cells may be a useful tool to identify patients with immune thrombocytopenia at a high risk of serious bleeding complications."
35025706,COVID-19 associated with immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Immune thrombocytopenia, also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), has emerged as a significant COVID-19-associated complication. This study analyzes the published literature of case reports and case series regarding COVID-19 infection associated with ITP.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a systematic search was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline through Clarivate and EBSCO to include the eligible studies. The authors utilized Review Manager 5.4 to conduct quantitative data synthesis for the condition of interest analysis.
A total of 13 eligible case reports and case series with 42 patients were included in this study; 54.8% of them were male. The pooled mean age of all participants was (59.5 ± 19) years with a median age of 63 years. The estimated mean time from diagnosis with COVID-19 to ITP development was 18.1 ± 21 days and the mean time to recovery from ITP was 5.8 ± 4.8 days. The pooled random effect of mean platelet count in the included six studies was 14.52, CI [8.79, 20.25].
Our analysis shows that ITP secondary to COVID-19 infection is slightly more prevalent among males (54.8%). Elderly patients were more vulnerable to the disease.    Most cases developed ITP within 2-3 weeks after COVID-19 infection and recovered in less than one week from ITP."
35023645,Thiol / disulfide balance and oxidative stress parameters in pediatric patients diagnosed with acute and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Changes in oxidative stress and thiol / disulfide balance are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Our study investigates total oxidant level (TOS), total antioxidant level (TAS), oxidative stress index (OSI) levels and thiol / disulfide balance in pediatric patients with acute and chronic ITP.
Thirty four patients with acute ITP, eighteen patients with chronic ITP and thirty three healthy children (control) were included. TOS, TAS, OSI, thiol / disulfide balance were analyzed.
In acute ITP, TAS levels were lower than chronic ITP and control, TOS and OSI levels were higher than control, and native thiol level was lower than chronic ITP (p < 0.05). In acute ITP; disulfide level, disulfide / native thiol and disulfide / total thiol ratios were higher than chronic ITP and control, and native thiol / total thiol ratio was lower than chronic ITP and control group (p = 0.038, p = 0.018, respectively). TOS and OSI levels of the chronic ITP were higher than the control group (p < 0.05).
The results of this study have shown that oxidative stress increases in children with acute ITP and chronic ITP, that thiol / disulfide balance is disrupted in favor of disulfide in acute ITP, and that thiol / disulfide balance isn`t disrupted in chronic ITP patients whose platelet count is close to normal and who don`t require treatment."
35022338,[Immune thrombocytopenia after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination].,"A 95-year-old male developed general subcutaneous petechiae, tongue hematoma, and melena two days after receiving the second BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two days later, his platelet count decreased to below 1,000/µl. Laboratory testing was positive for a slight increase in D-dimer, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin IgG antibody levels. There were no severe infections or symptomatic thrombosis. Platelet transfusions were transiently effective. He was diagnosed with newly developed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). We administered prednisolone (PSL) at 0.5 mg/kg/day and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 0.4 g/kg/day. From the following day, his platelet count rapidly increased, with an improvement in bleeding tendency. H. pylori was eradicated after platelet count recovery. Thrombocytopenia did not relapse although PSL was tapered three months later. Causes of thrombocytopenia after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination include ITP, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Differential diagnosis is important to determine the proper therapy. Case reports of newly diagnosed ITP after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been increasing recently. In these cases, including ours, the responses to steroids and IVIG were good. Further follow-up studies are needed to manage thrombocytopenia following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."
35022334,[Immune thrombocytopenia associated with Kimura's disease].,"In this study, we report a rare case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) associated with the worsening of Kimura's disease. A 47-year-old Japanese man with a pruritic rash and swollen inguinal lymph nodes was diagnosed with Kimura's disease on performing a right inguinal lymph node biopsy. Thrombocytopenia ensued after the diagnosis of Kimura's disease, and fluctuations in the platelet count were observed along with the pathology of Kimura's disease. The platelet count fluctuated repeatedly with the relapse of Kimura's disease and a diagnosis of a combination of Kimura's disease and ITP was made through lymph node regeneration and bone marrow examination. Treatment with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated for Kimura's disease and ITP, and lymphadenopathy and platelet count improved promptly. Since then, the dose of prednisolone has been gradually reduced, and the disease status of both Kimura's disease and ITP has been controlled."
35020287,Diagnostic value of platelet parameters and megakaryocyte formula of bone marrow in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"The parameters of the megakaryocyte formula and peripheral blood platelet indices were studied in 237 people with diagnoses of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A correlation analysis was performed between megakaryocyte subpopulations and platelet counts. The threshold values for MPV, PCT and PDW were determined by ROC analysis with the construction of the ROC curve, the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) and the cutoff threshold. The obtained values make it possible to make a differential diagnosis between ITP and MDS by platelet parameters of peripheral blood without examining the bone marrow."
35016175,Splenectomy Outcomes in Relapsed or Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenia according to First-Line Intravenous Immunoglobulin Response.,"Although splenectomy has long been second-line option for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients, an indicator that reliably predicts the efficacy of splenectomy is still being explored. We investigated the treatment outcomes of splenectomy as a second-line therapy for relapsed/refractory ITP according to first-line intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) responses.
Fifty-two adult patients treated with splenectomy as second-line therapy for ITP between 2009 and 2019 were included, and they were classified according to first-line IVIG responses (no response to IVIG: nonresponders; only transient IVIG response shorter than 4 weeks: poor responders; IVIG response for a longer period; stable responders). The efficacy of splenectomy was analyzed in the three subgroups.
Of the 52 patients, 10 were IVIG nonresponders, 34 were poor responders, and the remaining 8 were stable responders. Response to splenectomy was observed in 50.0% of IVIG nonresponders, 94.1% of poor responders, and 100% of stable responders (p = 0.0030). Among the 45 patients who responded to splenectomy, 51.1% relapsed subsequently, and a significantly lower relapse rate was noted in the stable IVIG responders (12.5%, p = 0.0220) than in nonresponders (60.0%) and poor responders (59.4%).
First-line IVIG response is indicated as a useful predictive factor for response to splenectomy."
35007700,Risk of thrombosis with thrombopoietin receptor agonists for ITP patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"One possible side effect of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in immune thrombocytopenia is thrombosis. Our aim is to systematically review whether patients with ITP that were treated with a TPO-RA have an increased risk for thrombosis as compared to ITP patients without TPO-RA. Patients in the intervention group were required to receive TPO-RA therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of thromboembolic events. Eleven studies were included in the pooled analysis. More thromboembolic events were noted in the TPO-RA group than in the control group: 25 compared to 4. Ten out of 11 studies showed a relative risk greater than 1. However, none of these individual risk ratios was statistically significant. The meta-analysis showed a RR of 1.82 [95 % CI 0.78-4.24]. Our findings indicate there is a non-significant higher chance of thrombosis in ITP patients with TPO-RA treatments versus ITP patients without TPO-RA treatment."
35000278,Alternate-day dosing of caplacizumab for immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"The anti-von Willebrand factor (VWF) nanobody caplacizumab directly prevents the fatal microthrombi formation in immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), thereby adding a new therapeutic principle to the treatment of this disorder. However, real-world treatment modalities beyond clinical trials remain heterogeneous.
Here, we describe the risks and benefits of an alternate-day dosing regimen for caplacizumab by thoroughly analyzing the timing and outcome of this approach in a retrospective cohort of 25 iTTP patients treated with caplacizumab at seven different medical centers in Austria and Germany between 2018 and 2021.
Alternate-day dosing of caplacizumab appeared feasible and led to persisting normal platelet counts in most patients. Five patients experienced iTTP exacerbations or relapses that led to the resumption of daily caplacizumab application. VWF activity was repeatedly measured in 16 of 25 patients and documented sufficient suppression by caplacizumab after 24 and 48 h in line with published pharmacodynamics.
Extension of caplacizumab application intervals from daily to alternate-day dosing may be safely considered in selected patients after 3 to 4 weeks of daily treatment. Earlier modifications may be discussed in low-risk patients but require close monitoring for clinical and laboratory features of thrombotic microangiopathy."

34992912,Multifocal spinal glioblastoma and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in an elderly male with hydrocephalus and myelopathy.,"Primary spinal glioblastoma multiforme with multifocal leptomeningeal enhancement is rarely diagnosed or documented. We describe a rare case of multifocal spinal isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type glioblastoma with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in an elderly male presenting with a chronic subdural hematoma, progressive myelopathy, and communicating hydrocephalus.
A 77-year-old male with a medical history of an acoustic schwannoma, anterior cranial fossa meningioma, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura presented with right-sided weakness after repeated falls. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine demonstrated a left-sided subdural hematoma, leptomeningeal enhancement of the brain and skull base, ventricles, and the cranial nerves, and along with florid enhancement of the leptomeninges from the cervicomedullary junction to the cauda equina. Most pertinent was focal thickening of the leptomeninges at T1 and T6 with mass effect on the spinal cord. A T6 laminectomy with excisional biopsy of the lesion was planned and completed. Findings were significant for glioblastoma the World Health Organization Grade IV IDH 1 wild type of the thoracic spinal cord. Subsequently, his mental status declined, and he developed progressive hydrocephalus which required cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Unfortunately, the patient had minimal improvement in his neurological exam and unfortunately died 2 months later.
In a review of the limited literature describing similar cases of primary spinal glioblastoma, the prognosis of this aggressive tumor remains unfavorable, despite aggressive treatment options. The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of this rare condition as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with multifocal invasive spinal lesions."

34962697,Thrombopoietin receptor agonists and rituximab for treatment of pediatric immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective clinical trials.,"Children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may require second-line ITP therapies. The high remission rate in pediatric patients, need for extended-duration use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), drug adherence, potential side effects, monitoring, and cost effectiveness are factors that should be considered in decision-making about second-line therapies. Rituximab (RTX) has been used off-label for years to treat ITP but there are limited studies about its efficacy and safety in children. To date, no studies have directly compared TPO-RAs with RTX for the treatment of childhood ITP.
This systematic review analyzed the overall platelet response, durability of treatment effect, and safety for RTX use in comparison to TPO-RAs in pediatric ITP. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched through December 2020 and meta-analysis was conducted using proportions of success/failure for each intervention in the selected studies.
The proportion of participants achieving the primary endpoint of a platelet response above 50,000 was similar for TPO-RAs (proportion = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.63-0.78) and RTX (proportion = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53-0.82). However, considerable variation was found between the two groups with regards to the sustainability of the response and other secondary outcomes such as need for rescue and adverse events. RTX was associated with higher rates of rescue therapy.
In this analysis of prospective pediatric ITP studies, RTX and TPO-RAs had similar rates of overall platelet response but differed in other important measures. Prospective comparative studies are needed to better characterize second-line treatments for pediatric ITP."
34962580,Current challenges of hematologic complications due to immune checkpoint blockade: a comprehensive review.,"Immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated durable clinical benefits in a variety of malignancies. These immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) produce unwanted autoimmune reactions due to an impaired self-tolerance. Hematologic immune-related adverse events (heme-irAEs) have been increasingly reported in the literature with a reported fatality rate of 12%. In this review, we illustrate 3 cases treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital for ICI-induced agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. We then summarize the available evidence regarding the incidence and prevalence of heme-irAEs. We identified immune thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia as the most commonly reported heme-irAEs which are more commonly observed with nivolumab therapy. Median time to onset of heme-irAEs varies between patients but occurs earlier with CTLA-4 inhibitors than with anti-PD-L1/PD-1 agents. We also describe the current challenges regarding the recurrence of heme-irAEs despite immune checkpoint blockade termination. We provide the available evidence supporting a mixed T-cell and B-cell immune-mediated response. Finally, we review the treatment algorithm of these complications and provide treatment alternatives to steroid-refractory cases."
34961933,Eltrombopag in paediatric immune thrombocytopenia: Iron metabolism modulation in mesenchymal stromal cells.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease caused by platelet destruction mediated by auto-antibody production. It is characterized by a compromised immune system and alteration of the inflammatory response. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play an important role in modulating immune and inflammatory processes, exerting immune-suppressing and anti-inflammatory properties. In ITP-MSCs the activity and survival are strongly impaired. Eltrombopag (ELT) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved in chronic ITP for stimulating platelet production. It has immunomodulating properties by stimulating T and B regulatory cell activity and by promoting a macrophage switch from the pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory phenotype. ELT also exhibits iron-chelating properties. Iron is a crucial element involved in several physiologic processes, but its intracellular accumulation determines cell damages. Therefore, for the first time we analysed the effect of ELT on ITP-MSCs demonstrating its ability to restore survival and activity of MSCs directly and to promote their survival and proliferation indirectly, by iron metabolism modulation."
34961516,"Immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drug protocols in the treatment of canine primary immune thrombocytopenia, a scoping review.","Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a cause of severe thrombocytopenia in dogs. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid drugs are frequently used in the management of ITP, but treatment failure may occur. Immunomodulatory and non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs might improve outcomes from therapy either alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The objectives of this scoping review were (1) to evaluate the current evidence relating to immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drug protocols in the treatment of canine ITP, and (2) to answer the clinical question, whether or not therapy with immunomodulatory or non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs alone or in combination with corticosteroids could improve outcome, compared to therapy with corticosteroids alone. A literature search was performed in the electronic databases of Agricola, CAB Abstracts, Embase, Medline and Web of Science for publications in November 2019 and again February 1, 2021. Selection criteria were relatively strict and included peer-reviewed research papers reporting outcome measures from immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drug protocols in the treatment of canine ITP with a pre-therapeutic mean or median platelet count < 50,000/µL as a strict criterion for inclusion. Studies were evaluated if they had an appropriate diagnostic work up to exclude underlying conditions. Outcome measures and adverse events were compared between drug protocols both within studies and between studies. The search identified 456 studies, with six studies being eligible for inclusion. The studies were mostly case series while two were randomized controlled trials. Level of evidence varied with an overall uncertain subject enrollment, small groups, inadequate description and variable use of drug protocols or outcome measures. For outcomes such as platelet recovery time and duration of hospitalization, an improvement was observed using adjunctive therapy (human intravenous immunoglobulin) compared to therapy with corticosteroids alone. For outcomes of complete platelet recovery time, survival (6-month), mortality and relapse, no improvement was observed using adjunctive drugs compared to corticosteroids alone. Specifically, therapy with mycophenolate mofetil alone and adjunctive azathioprine were associated with more severe adverse events compared to other drug protocols. Evidence relating to immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drug protocols in the treatment of canine ITP was of variable quality. Future larger case-controlled trials are required for determination of optimal treatment protocols in canine ITP."
34959233,Romiplostim for Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia in Routine Clinical Practice: Results from a Multicentre Observational Study in Germany.,"The effectiveness and safety of romiplostim were evaluated by immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) phase (newly diagnosed/persistent/chronic) at romiplostim initiation.
This is a post hoc analysis of a prospective, German, multicentre, observational study in adults with ITP who received ≥1 dose of romiplostim. Follow-up data were collected for ≤2 years. Outcomes included overall platelet response (≥1 platelet count ≥50 × 109/L at 2-24 weeks after romiplostim initiation) or durable platelet response (≥75% of measurements ≥50 × 109/L at 14-24 weeks) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), evaluated by ITP phase.
Data from 96 patients were analysed (newly diagnosed, n = 18; persistent, n = 25; chronic, n = 53). During the 2- to 24-week follow-up, overall platelet response was achieved in 100% (95% confidence interval: 81.5-100), 100% (86.3-100), and 96.2% (87.0-99.5) of patients with newly diagnosed, persistent, or chronic ITP, respectively, and platelet responses were durable in 88.2% (63.6-98.5), 65.0% (40.8-84.6), and 69.4% (54.6-81.7) of patients. During the 2-year follow-up, ADRs occurred in 24.0-35.8% of patients across phases. Two patients with chronic ITP experienced bone marrow ADRs; no thrombotic ADRs occurred.
Romiplostim was effective and well tolerated in patients with newly diagnosed, persistent, or chronic ITP in routine clinical practice."
34957618,N-glycan profiling alterations of serum and immunoglobulin G in immune thrombocytopenia.,"The glycosylation alterations of serum and IgG are involved in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and have shown great potential in biomarker field. The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is exclusive. Our study aimed to discover the potential glyco-biomarkers for auxiliary diagnosis of ITP.
The serum samples were obtained from 61 ITP patients and 35 healthy controls, and IgG samples were purified from 34 out of 61 ITP patients and 35 healthy controls. DNA sequencer-assisted fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (DSA-FACE) was used to analyze serum and IgG N-glycan profiling.
6 of 12 serum N-glycan peaks, 6 of 7 IgG N-glycan peaks, serum fucosylation, and IgG galactosylation were significantly different between ITP patients and healthy controls (p < 0.05). IgG peak 7 showed good diagnostic efficacy for discriminating ITP patients from healthy individuals (AUC 0.967). ITP patients with severe thrombocytopenia had a significantly lower serum fucosylation than ITP patients with mild and moderate thrombocytopenia (p < 0.05). Serum fucosylation and serum peak 5 were correlated with platelet counts in ITP patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and the absolute values of correlation coefficient were both over 0.5.
The specific N-glycan patterns of serum and IgG were observed in ITP patients. IgG peak 7 was a potential biomarker for auxiliary diagnosis of ITP."
34956221,Immune Thrombocytopenia Induced by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitrs in Lung Cancer: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), are being extensively used on advanced human malignancies therapy. The treatment with ICIs have acquired durable tumor inhibition and changed the treatment landscape in lung cancer. Immune-related adverse events including pneumonitis and thyroiditis have been well described, but less frequent events, such as ICIs-induced thrombocytopenia, are now emerging and may sometimes be severe or fatal. Since early detection and prompt intervention are crucial to prevent fatal consequences, it is of outmost importance that medical staff is aware of these potential toxicities and learn to recognize and treat them adequately. This review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, mechanisms, and clinical management of ICIs-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with lung cancer. We also present a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who received the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab and eventually developed severe thrombocytopenia. The case indirectly suggests that cytokine changes might contribute to immune dysregulation in ICIs-induced thrombocytopenia."
34946271,Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in a Patient with Previous Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: How to Manage Imatinib Together with Eltrombopag.,"The occurrence of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or other myeloproliferative diseases, after the development of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is very rare in the current medical literature. Considering the advances in ITP management, and the wide use of new drugs for ITP and CML, we report an unusual case with this association. Our case report focused on a 64-year-old man with long-standing ITP treated with eltrombopag, who developed hyperleukocytosis during follow-up; after specific laboratory exams, it was diagnosed as CML and he began treatment with imatinib. The treatment with eltrombopag was balanced with imatinib to stabilize his platelet count. Data on bcr-abl and JAK2 transcripts were collected and revealed an optimal response with the achievement of negativization of both molecular signatures. We could demonstrate that treatment with imatinib and eltrombopag was well tolerated and allowed complete molecular remission of CML to be achieved, as well as of ITP."
34945283,Clot Waveform Analysis Demonstrates Low Blood Coagulation Ability in Patients with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.,"Although platelets, which contain large amounts of phospholipids, play an important role in blood coagulation, there is still no routine assay to examine the effects of platelets in blood coagulation.
Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with thrombocytopenia, including those with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), were examined using clot wave analysis (CWA)-small-amount tissue-factor-induced FIX activation (sTF/FIXa) and thrombin time (TT).
Although there were no marked differences in the three parameters of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) between normal healthy volunteers and typical patients with ITP, the peak heights of the CWA-sTF/FIXa were markedly low in patients with ITP. The three peak times of the CWA-sTF/FIXa in patients with a platelet count of ≤8.0 × 10
The CWA-sTF/FIXa and CWA-TT results showed that blood coagulation is enhanced by platelets and that the blood coagulation ability in ITP patients was low in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with other types of thrombocytopenia."
34943895,Platelet Activation Mechanisms and Consequences of Immune Thrombocytopenia.,"Autoimmune disorders are often associated with low platelet count or thrombocytopenia. In immune-induced thrombocytopenia (IIT), a common mechanism is increased platelet activity, which can have an increased risk of thrombosis. In addition, or alternatively, auto-antibodies suppress platelet formation or augment platelet clearance. Effects of the auto-antibodies are linked to the unique structural and functional characteristics of platelets. Conversely, prior platelet activation may contribute to the innate and adaptive immune responses. Extensive interplay between platelets, coagulation and complement activation processes may aggravate the pathology. Here, we present an overview of the reported molecular causes and consequences of IIT in the most common forms of autoimmune disorders. These include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), COVID-19 vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (VITT), thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP), and hemolysis, the elevated liver enzymes and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome. We focus on the platelet receptors that bind auto-antibodies, the immune complexes, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and complement factors. In addition, we review how circulating platelets serve as a reservoir of immunomodulatory molecules. By this update on the molecular mechanisms and the roles of platelets in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, we highlight platelet-based pathways that can predispose for thrombocytopenia and are linked thrombotic or bleeding events."
34941989,COVID-19 vaccination in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder that is characterized by low platelet count and increased bleeding risk. COVID-19 vaccination has been described as a risk factor for de novo ITP, but the effects of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with ITP are unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with ITP on platelet count, bleeding complications, and ITP exacerbation (≥50% decline in platelet count, or nadir platelet count < 30 × 109/L with a >20% decrease from baseline, or use of rescue therapy). Platelet counts in patients with ITP and healthy controls were collected immediately before and 1 and 4 weeks after the first and second vaccinations. Linear mixed-effects modeling was applied to analyze platelet counts over time. We included 218 patients with ITP (50.9% female; mean age, 55 years; and median platelet count, 106 × 109/L) and 200 healthy controls (60.0% female; mean age, 58 years; median platelet count, 256 × 109/L). Platelet counts decreased by 6.3% after vaccination. We did not observe any difference in decrease between the groups. Thirty patients with ITP (13.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.5-19.1) had an exacerbation and 5 (2.2%; 95% CI, 0.7-5.3) suffered from a bleeding event. Risk factors for ITP exacerbation were platelet count < 50 × 109/L (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% CI, 2.1-13.7), ITP treatment at time of vaccination (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5-8.0), and age (OR, 0.96 per year; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99). Our study highlights the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with ITP and the importance of the close monitoring of platelet counts in a subgroup of patients with ITP. Patients with ITP with exacerbation responded well on therapy."
34941194,Acute exacerbation of pulmonary toxoplasmosis during corticosteroid therapy for immune thrombocytopenia: A case report and literature review.,"Pulmonary toxoplasmosis (PT) is an infectious disease that can be fatal if reactivation occurs in the recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) who were previously infected with Toxoplasma gondii. However, whether the toxoplasmosis reactivation is an actual risk factor for patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies without HSCT remains unclear. Therefore, reactivated PT is not typically considered as a differential diagnosis for pneumonia other than in patients with HSCT or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
A 77-year-old man presented with fever and nonproductive cough for several days. He was hospitalized due to atypical pneumonia that worsened immediately despite antibiotic therapy. Before 4 months, he was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and received corticosteroid therapy. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (ST) was administered to prevent pneumocystis pneumonia resulting from corticosteroid therapy.
The serological and culture test results were negative for all pathogens except T. gondii immunoglobulin G antibody. Polymerase chain reaction, which can detect T. gondii from frozen bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, showed positive results. Therefore, he was diagnosed with PT.
ST, clindamycin, and azithromycin were administered. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine could not be administered because his general condition significantly worsened at the time of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination.
The patient died of acute respiratory distress syndrome despite anti-T. gondii treatment. An autopsy revealed a severe organizing pneumonia and a small area of bronchopneumonia.
PT should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with pneumonia, particularly in seropositive patients who receive immunosuppressive therapies even for other than HSCT or HIV."
34939200,Amifostine and rituximab in refractory immune thrombocytopaenia: A case series.,"Management of refractory immune thrombocytopaenia (ITP) can be challenging. Amifostine, a thiophosphate prodrug, induces megakaryocyte maturation. In 2010, Fan et al. published results for 21 Chinese splenectomized patients, aged 13-92, with steroid-refractory ITP. Nineteen patients (15 patients aged  >18 years) achieved remission 2 months post-amifostine. This is the first publication utilizing amifostine and rituximab in refractory ITP.
At the Cairns Hospital in Australia, we identified five patients treated with amifostine and rituximab for refractory ITP. Amifostine IV 400 mg once daily was administered 5 days/week for 5 weeks as tolerated. Rituximab was administered concurrently with/preceding amifostine based on clinician preference. Data were obtained through medical records and follow-up serology up to 5 years post-amifostine was available.
Three cases demonstrated durable responses up to 5 years' follow-up. One patient initially achieved remission but relapsed 1-year post-amifostine. One patient who did not have a splenectomy prior to amifostine did not respond.
Three out of five patients achieved durable responses with amifostine and rituximab. Although there is confounding by rituximab, given its established low durable response rate, it is likely that the excellent long-term responses achieved were a result of amifostine. Clinical trials with larger patient cohorts and further investigation are required to confirm the efficacy and mechanism of amifostine in ITP."
34938937,Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: Personalized therapy using ADAMTS-13 activity and autoantibodies.,"Recently, treatment of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITTP) has changed with the advent of caplacizumab in clinical practice. The International Working Group (IWG) has recently integrated the ADAMTS-13 activity/autoantibody monitoring in consensus outcome definitions. We report three ITTP cases during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, that received a systematic evaluation of ADAMTS-13 activity and autoantibodies. We describe how the introduction of caplacizumab and ADAMTS-13 monitoring could change the management of ITTP patients and discuss whether therapeutic choices should be based on the clinical response alone. ADAMTS-13 activity/antibodies were assessed every 5 days. Responses were evaluated according to updated IWG outcome definitions. These kinetics, rather than clinical remission, guided the therapy, allowing early and safe caplacizumab discontinuation and sensible administration of rituximab. Caplacizumab was cautiously discontinued after achieving ADAMTS-13 complete remission. These cases illustrate that prospective ADAMTS-13 evaluation and use of updated IWG definitions may improve real-life patients' management in the caplacizumab era."

Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, known to increase platelet count in patients with refractory ITP. Thrombotic adverse events have been described in association with Eltrombopag administration.
A young female patient of Ethiopian ancestry with systemic lupus erythematosus, triple Antiphospholipid (APLA) positive serology and refractory ITP who received Eltrombopag and 2 weeks later developed catastrophic APLA syndrome with severe Libman-Sacks endocarditis of the mitral and aortic valves, multiple intracerebral infracts and arterial thrombosis of the left upper limb.
Eltrombopag is a salvage drug, used in refractory ITP. Thrombotic adverse events, some of which may be life-threatening, are a possible complication, especially in high-risk patients."

23183237,Aggressive fatal case of autoimmune hemorrhaphilia resulting from anti-Factor XIII antibodies.,"Factor XIII (FXIII) is a fibrin-stabilizing factor consisting of catalytic A subunits (FXIII-A) and carrier B subunits (FXIII-B). Congenital FXIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder. Acquired FXIII deficiency resulting from FXIII hypo-synthesis and/or hyperconsumption is a relatively common disorder in which patients seldom bleed. On the contrary, 'autoimmune/acquired hemorrhaphilia XIII/13 due to anti-FXIII antibodies (AH13)' is a rare but life-threatening bleeding disorder. Through a nationwide survey of AH13, we diagnosed aggressive AH13 in a 66-year-old woman. She consulted our department because of a spontaneous hematoma in her hand. After 1.5 months, she also developed an intramuscular hematoma but retained approximately half (52%) of the normal FXIII activities. The patient's bleeding symptoms were aggravated to catastrophic massive bleedings in the large abdominal muscles and intrapelvic and intraperitoneal spaces. Two months after the bleeding onset, she died despite undergoing plasma exchange, which was performed because we were deeply suspicious of the presence of an anti-FXIII inhibitor. Seven days after her death, extremely low FXIII activity (6%) and positive data on anti-FXIII inhibitor were reported by a commercial laboratory. Our dot blot assay detected anti-FXIII-A autoantibodies, afterwards. Thus, the diagnosis of aggressive AH13 as early as possible is necessary to save patients' lives."
8585022,The reproductive health of women with von Willebrand Disease unresponsive to DDAVP: results of an international survey. On behalf of the Subcommittee on von Willebrand Factor of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the ISTH.,"An international registry was established on the reproductive health of women with types of von Willebrand disease (vWd) unresponsive to DDAVP. Data was collected on 44 women from 16 treatment centers in nine countries. Severe menorrhagia requiring blood product therapy occurred at least once in 80% of the women for whom data was reported. Most of the reported episodes occurred prior to the diagnosis of vWd and/or the use of oral contraceptive (OC) therapy. OC therapy was clinically effective in the treatment of chronic menorrhagia in 22 of 25 (88%) women treated. Two of the women, however, were unable to tolerate chronic OC use and a third became refractory to treatment. Hysterectomy was performed in 10 of the 44 women (23%). The reported indication for six of the procedures was menorrhagia. Seventy percent were performed at two treatment centers, suggesting different thresholds for the performance of the procedure. There were 69 pregnancies reported in 31 of the 44 women. Fifteen of the pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortions. The incidence of miscarriage was 22% and appeared clustered, with 10 of 15 of the miscarriages occurring in just four of the women."
6981997,Estrogens and surgery in women with von Willebrand's disease.,"While receiving estrogen therapy, three women with classic type I von Willebrand's disease showed significantly less bleeding and improved hemostasis. One took estrogens to prevent menopausal symptoms, and two used oral contraceptives. These women underwent major surgery without excessive bleeding and without requiring cryoprecipitate or other blood components. Prior to estrogen therapy, each woman had received cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma to stop bleeding from dental extractions or other surgical procedures. Furthermore, two other women with type I von Willebrand's disease also exhibited improved hemostasis while taking oral contraceptives. These experiences suggest a short course of estrogen therapy may effectively prepare some women with von Willebrand's disease for elective surgery.
Von Willebrand's disease causes spontaneous bleeding from mucocutaneous surfaces and excessive blood loss after surgery. Some women with the disease have less spontaneous hemorrhage and show improved coagulation while taking oral contraceptives (OCs) or while pregnant; estrogens are believed responsible for these improvements. 3 women are described who had previously received infusions of either fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate to stop postoperative hemorrhage, and exhibited prolonged bleeding times, abnormal platelet retention results, and decreased plasma levels of factor VIII-related coagulant, factor VIII-related antigen, and factor VIII-related von Willebrand factor. However while taking estrogens they experienced cessation of spontaneous bleeding episodes and exhibited normal coagulation test results; all observed less epistaxis and spontaneous bruising during pregnancy. Continuing estrogen therapy, each woman underwent major surgery with no abnormal bleeding an no blood component therapy. 2 other women with type 1 von Willebrand's disease also exhibited improved hemostasis while taking OCs. It is unclear how estrogens stimulate synthesis of the various factor VIII components and for certain women with von Willebrand's disease certain estrogens may improve hemostasis more effectively than others. Estrogens might obviate the need for cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma to assure hemostasis, thereby eliminating the threat of transfusion-induced hepatitis and reducing surgical costs."

7652691,Development of a rat model for orthotopic liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Surgical resection is of limited benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by severe liver cirrhosis or multicentric hepatic cancer. The long-term survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after transplantation is quite poor. We have studied the characteristics, natural course, and cause of diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer in rats and have shown it to be a good model of liver cancer in human beings. Therefore we performed orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in rats with diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer to study the patterns of recurrence.
Diethylnitrosamine 100 parts per million in drinking water was administered daily for 4 months to male inbred LEW rats. A laparotomy was performed 120 or 134 days after commencing the oral diethylnitrosamine to confirm the induction of cancer confined grossly to the liver. The livers were resected, and orthotopic transplantation with livers of normal LEW rats was performed.
By day 150 all the rats in the non-OLT group died of intraabdominal hemorrhage caused by spontaneous rupture of liver cancer (mean survival time +/- SD, 138.2 +/- 5.3 days; n = 14). However, the OLT (day 120) group recovered their body weight comparatively early after transplantation and survived a maximum of 218 days until death from recurrence (203.8 +/- 21.3 days; n = 4). A significant extension in survival time was observed (p < 0.01). In autopsies performed at the time of death, metastatic liver cancer was observed in the transplanted livers with two showing metastases to the lung. The cause of death was cancer in all the rats. However, the OLT (day 134) group all died of major complications of severe pneumonia and disseminated intravascular coagulation within 2 weeks of OLT (141.3 +/- 5.0 days; n = 4).
After liver transplantation to rats with hepatocellular cancer confined to the liver, recurrence was observed at a comparatively early stage in all transplant recipients. Although a significant prolongation of survival was noted, they all died of cancer. The timing of transplantation is also an important factor. This experimental liver transplantation model of progressive rat liver cancer will be useful in the study of primary liver cancer in human beings."
3839606,Defibrination during warfarin therapy in a man with protein C deficiency.,"A 57 year old man presented with apparently spontaneous lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. He was treated in conventional fashion with intravenous heparin and oral warfarin. After 4 daily doses of warfarin the prothrombin and proconvertin (P+P) time was within therapeutic range, and heparin was stopped. Over the next six hours complete defibrination occurred, associated with severe bleeding complications. Functional protein C measured after normalization of routine coagulation tests averaged 40% of normal, and was only 3.5% of normal immediately prior to the episode of defibrination. We conclude that the very low functional protein C levels seen immediately prior to defibrination were caused by a combination of pre-existent protein C deficiency and warfarin therapy, and directly predisposed to defibrination once heparin was stopped, despite ""therapeutic"" warfarin anticoagulation. Exacerbation of intravascular coagulation should be considered a potential prothrombotic effect of warfarin therapy in protein C deficient individuals."
30785249,[Multiple ischemic stroke in Osler-Rendu-Weber disease].,"Hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder caused by the mutation of several possible genes and characterized by malformations of the arteriovenous system in multiple organs. The clinical diagnosis is based on the Curaçao criteria ((1) spontaneous, recurrent epistaxis; (2) teleangiectasias in characteristic sites (lips, oral cavity, nose, fingers); (3) visceral lesions (gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cerebral, spinal); (4) affected first degree relative). The aim of this study is to present the first genetically confirmed Hungarian case of hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia with multiple ischemic strokes. Our 70-year-old woman has been suffering from severe epistaxis since her childhood and presented gastrointestinal bleeding during her adulthood as well. The characteristic skin lesions developed in the 5th decade of life. She was admitted to our department with loss of consciousness and fluctuating speech and swallowing problems. MRI of the brain supplemented with angiography revealed multiple arteriovenous malformations and multiple subacute ischemic lesions. The EEG demonstrated slowing of electric activity in the left frontal lobe. The neuropsychological assessment showed deficits in anterograde memory and executive functions. The diagnostic work-up for other characteristic alterations identified an arteriovenous malformation in the left lung. The genetic analysis demonstrated a heterozygous mutation in the 7th exon of the ENG gene at position 834 resulting in a thymine duplication and an early stop codon by a frame shift. The present case is largely similar to those already described in literature and draws the attention to the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of HHT patients.
A hereditaer haemorrhagiás teleangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber-kór) olyan autoszomális domináns módon öröklődő, több lehetséges gén mutációja által okozott megbetegedés, amit az arteriovenosus rendszer több szervben is megjelenő malformációja jellemez. A klinikai diagnózist a Curaçao-kritériumok [1. spontán, visszatérő epistaxis; 2. karakterisztikus lokalizációban elhelyezkedő teleangiectasiák (ajak, szájüreg, orr, ujjak); 3. visceralis laesiók (gastrointestinalis, pulmonalis, cereb­ralis, spinalis); 4. elsőfokú érintett családtag] alapján állíthatjuk fel. A jelen közlemény célja Magyarországon elsőként egy multiplex ischaemiás stroke-kal társuló, genetikailag igazolt HHT-s eset ismertetése. 70 éves nőbetegünk gyermekkora óta súlyos orrvérzésektől szenvedett, felnőttkorára gastrointestinalis vérzései jelent­keztek. Bőrtünetei életének 5. évtizedében jelentkeztek a típusos lokalizációkban. Osztályunkra eszméletvesztéses rosszullét, fluktuáló beszédzavar, valamint nyelészavar miatt került. Az angiográfiás felvételekkel is kiegészített koponya-MRI több lokalizációban igazolt arteriovenosus malformációt, valamint szubakut multiplex ischaemiás laesiónak megfelelő eltéréseket. Az EEG-vizsgálat lassult elektromos tevékenységet mutatott a bal frontális lebenynek megfelelően. A beteg neuropszichológiai állapotfelmérése során az anterográd memória és a végrehajtó funkciók érintettsége volt valószínűsíthető. A beteg részletes kivizsgálása során a bal tüdőfélben arteriovenosus malformációt diagnosztizáltak. Genetikai diagnosztika során az endoglin gén 7. exonjában a 834. pozícióban egy heterozigóta formában jelen lévő timinduplikáció igazolódott, ami kereteltolódás révén egy korai stop kodon kialakulását eredményezte. Az ismertetett eset nagymértékben hasonlít a szakirodalomban már leírtakhoz és a multidiszciplináris együttműködés jelentőségére hívja fel a figyelmet a HHT-s betegek ellátásában."
17345820,[Epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia].,"Spontaneous recurrent epistaxis is the most common clinical manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia (HHT). It occurs in more than 90% of HHT patients and is the most distressing symptom. Nasal teleangiectasias tend to increase with age both in size and number, so epistaxis is heavier and more frequent. For patients with mild to moderate disease, there are many adequate treatment options. For those with severe disease, most treatments offer just a hemorrhage-free interval. Experienced otorhinolaryngologists who treat epistaxis in these patients often use the adage ""to do as little as possible for as long as possible"".
The recommendations for the management of acute epistaxis include: compression, use of topical antifibrinolytics, laser therapy, argon plasma coagulation therapy, fibrin sealant spray or gelatin sponge soaked in adrenaline. In cases of heavy acute epistaxis, an epistaxis balloon combined with artery ligation and/or embolization is the most effective treatment. Nasal packing and electrocauterisation should be avoided to prevent further trauma to the blood vessels.
Management of recurrent epistaxis includes topical application of laser energy (argon, Nd:YAG, KTP/532 and diode, not CO2), argon plasma coagulation in combination with 0.1% estriol ointment, caustics, antifibrinolytics, bleomycin and sclerosing substances. Systemic estrogen-progesterone at doses used for oral contraception may eliminate bleeding in women with heavy epistaxis. Systemic antifibrinolitics (used with extreme precaution) and septal dermoplasty give good results. The only method which successfully and permanently solves the problem of severe refractory epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia is closure of the nasal cavities."
36372930,Persisting dental foci increase the risk for bacterial infections before and after liver transplant.,"Patients awaiting liver transplant are usually assessed for presence of dental foci to prevent bacterial infection post-transplant, but evidence to support dental examination and treatment is limited. We investigated if treatment of dental foci decreased bacterial infections before and after transplant.
Patients transplanted at the university hospital of Bonn were retrospectively assessed for occurrence of bacterial infections before and after transplant according to presence and treatment of dental foci.
35/110 patients showed good oral health, 39/110 patients received dental care and 36/110 patients did not receive dental care despite poor oral health. Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease presented with the highest rate of dental foci. Bleeding complications due to oral care occurred in five patients with poor coagulation. After transplant, the number of infections per patient was higher in patients with poor oral health (2.9) compared to patients after dental care (1.9) or with good oral health (1.8) (p = .02), with streptococcal infections being more frequent in patients with poor oral health. Before transplant, bacterial infections, in particular bacteraemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, were also more common in patients with untreated dental foci. Streptococci and Staphylococci were more often detected in patients with dental foci. Dental treatment was associated with a reduction in bacterial infections.
Presence of dental foci is associated with an increased risk for bacterial infections not only after but also before liver transplant. Dental treatment might be a safe and effective procedure to mitigate this risk."
36106301,Liver Transplantation for Treatment of Unresectable Spontaneous Ruptured Hepatocellular Adenoma: A Rare Indication.,"Hepatocellular Adenomas (HA) are rare benign tumors of the liver which occur predominantly in young women. Although benign, HA may have complications such as hemorrhage and malignant transformation. So, sometimes conservative management is not enough. We report a case of a 26-year-old woman on oral contraceptives who presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of hemodynamic shock. She underwent transarterial embolization due to the presence of multiple HA with rupture and active hemorrhage. This minimally invasive treatment failed to control the disease. The patient presented a progressive increase in the size of the masses with signs of recent hemorrhage, and the HA became unresectable, so she underwent liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is rarely indicated for the treatment of HA; however, in unresectable masses, it should be considered to prevent potential rupture with hemorrhage or malignant transformation."
31541422,Treatment with carvedilol improves survival of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure: a randomized controlled trial.,"In addition to the portal pressure reducing effect, non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) have possible immunomodulatory and effect in reducing bacterial translocation. Recently, it has been shown that patients who are already on NSBBs should be continued on them (if feasible), if acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) develops. It, however, remains unknown if patients with ACLF and no or small esophageal varices at presentation will benefit from the use of NSBBs. We studied the efficacy and safety of carvedilol in patients with ACLF in reducing mortality, variceal bleeding and non-bleeding complications.
136 patients with ACLF (with no or small esophageal varices and HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg) were randomized to either carvedilol (n = 66) or placebo arms (n = 70).
Within 28 days, 7 (10.6%) of 66 patients in the carvedilol group and 17 (24.3%) of 70 in the placebo group died (p= 0.044). Fewer patients in the carvedilol compared to placebo group developed acute kidney injury (AKI) (13.6% vs 35.7%, p = 0.003 and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (6.1% vs 21.4%, p= 0.013). Significantly, more patients in the placebo group had increase in APASL ACLF Research Consortium-ACLF grade (22.9% vs 6.1%, p= 0.007). There was no significant difference in the 90-day transplant-free survival rate and development of AKI, SBP, non-SBP infections (including pneumonia) and variceal bleed within 90 days, between the two groups.
In ACLF patients with either no or small esophageal varices and HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg, carvedilol leads to improved survival and fewer AKI and SBP events up to 28 days. CLINICALTRIALS.

28630388,Spontaneous liver rupture associated with anticoagulant therapy A case report.,"Spontaneous hepatic rupture without underlying liver diseases is uncommon entity. We report a rare case of spontaneous rupture of liver hematoma in patient treated with warfarin end enoxaparin sodium because of pulmonary embolism. Two day after admission the patient complained generalized abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. The abdominal US and TC scan revealed free fluid and lesion at right liver lobe. The patient, despite intravenous fluid support and blood transfusion, was hemodinamically instable and urgent laparotomy was needed. At laparotomy, it was found that a subcapsular haematoma, involving the diaphragmatic face of the right liver, had ruptured into peritoneum. Hepatic bleeding was stopped using a conservative approach by Pringle manoeuvre, parenchymal suture and fibrin sealant. There was no complication related to hepatic surgery but the patient died because of new massive pulmonary embolism 10 days after surgery. The absence of underlying liver pathology was confirmed by autopsy examination. This case report suggests that the possibility of spontaneous liver rupture should be considered in patients being treated with oral anticoagulants. Early diagnosis are critically important given the high morbidity and mortality. Aggressive resuscitation and immediate exploratory laparotomy is needed when hemodynamic instability occurs. In our case a quick, safe and effective control of bleeding was provided by partial vascular occlusion, parenchymal suture and topical haemostatic agent.

La rottura spontanea di fegato in assenza di malattie epatiche concomitanti è un evento abbastanza raro. Nel nostro lavoro illustriamo un raro caso di rottura spontanea di fegato in un paziente in trattamento con warfarin ed enoxaparina sodica a causa di una embolia polmonare. Due giorni dopo la dimissione il paziente lamentava dolori addominali generalizzati e presentava instabilità emodinamica. L’ecografia addominale e la TC addome mostravano versamento libero in addome ed una lesione a carico del fegato destro. Nonostante la terapia infusionale di supporto e le trasfusioni, il paziente continuava ad essere instabile da un punto di vista emodinamico; si decideva pertanto di eseguire una laparotomia d’urgenza. Alla apertura della cavità addominale vi è stato il riscontro di un ematoma sotto-glissoniano che coinvolgeva la faccia diaframmatica del fegato di destra e che si era aperto in addome. Il sanguinamento è stato controllato con approccio conservativo utilizzando la manovra di Pringle, sutura del parenchima ed uso di emostatici. Non si sono osservate complicanze correlate all’intervento ma il paziente è deceduto a causa di un nuovo episodio di embolia polmonare massiva, in decima giornata postoperatoria. L’esame autoptico ha confermato l’assenza di patologie epatiche concomitanti. La possibilità di una rottura spontanea di fegato andrebbe sempre considerata in pazienti in trattamento con anticoagulanti. La diagnosi precoce è fondamentale date l’alta morbilità e mortalità. Una terapia rianimatoria aggressiva ed una laparotomia esplorativa d’urgenza sono indicate in caso di instabilità emodinamica. Nel nostro caso, un rapido e sicuro controllo dell’emostasi sono stati possibili grazie ad una emostasi compressiva, sutura diretta del parenchima ed uso di emostatici."
26109822,Hemorrhagic hemangioma in the liver: A case report.,"Hemangioma is the most common type of benign tumor that arises in the liver. Although rupture and hemorrhage of hepatic hemangioma are rare complications, they can be the cause of mortality. The authors report a case of hemorrhagic hepatic hemangioma: in a 54-year-old woman who was admitted with epigastric pain. She had taken oral contraceptives several weeks prior. The results of a blood examination were normal. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a tumor in hepatic segment 4, and a hemorrhage inside the cystic mass was suspected. The mass was removed laparoscopically to confirm the tumor properties and control the hemorrhage. The pathologic findings of the resected mass were consistent with hepatic hemangioma with intratumoral hemorrhage. The patient was discharged 8 d after the surgery, without further complications or complaints, and the patient's condition was found to have improved during follow-up."
25548746,A case of focal nodular hyperplasia with growth progression during pregnancy.,"Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common benign solid tumor of the liver and is usually found in young females. In FNH, spontaneous bleeding or rupture rarely occurs and malignant transformation is unlikely. The etiology of FNH is unclear, but because of female predominance and young age at onset, it seems that female hormone has an important role for the development of FNH. Although the development and the complications of hepatocellular adenomas have been related to the use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy, the influence of oral contraceptives and pregnancy on the growth and complications of FNH is controversial. Most FNH are stable in size and rarely complicated during pregnancy. We describe here a case of FNH with growth progression during pregnancy in a 27-year-old female. Her course of pregnancy and delivery was uneventful. Two months after delivery, the size of FNH was decreased."
20824832,Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis seems to decrease the incidence of bacterial infections. Oral antibiotics, active against enteric bacteria, have been commonly used as antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002.
To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index EXPANDED until June 2010. In addition, we handsearched the references of all identified studies.
Randomised clinical trials comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with no intervention, placebo, or another antibiotic to prevent bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
Three authors independently assessed trial quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Association measures were relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes.
Twelve trials (1241 patients) evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo or no antibiotic prophylaxis. All trials were at risk of bias. Antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no intervention or placebo was associated with beneficial effects on mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98), mortality from bacterial infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97), bacterial infections (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.49), rebleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74), days of hospitalisation (MD -1.91, 95% CI -3.80 to -0.02), bacteraemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40), pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57), and urinary tract infections (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41). No serious adverse events were reported. The trials showed no significant heterogeneity of effects. Another five trials (650 patients) compared different antibiotic regimens. Data could not be combined as each trial used different antibiotic regimen. None of the examined antibiotic regimen was superior to the control regimen regarding mortality or bacterial infections.
Prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding significantly reduced bacterial infections, and seems to have reduced all-cause mortality, bacterial infection mortality, rebleeding events, and hospitalisation length. These benefits were observed independently of the type of antibiotic used; thus, no specific antibiotic can be preferred. Therefore, antibiotic selection should be made considering local conditions such as bacterial resistance profile and treatment cost."
20716048,Acute gastric variceal bleeding during orthotopic liver transplant.,"We present a case of intraoperative gastric variceal bleeding during liver transplant. After an uneventful induction and surgical dissection, our patient developed hemodynamic instability during the anhepatic phase. We believe that an increase in portal pressures, owing to clamping of the portal system, led to spontaneous variceal rupture; however, placement of an oral gastric tube or transesophageal echocardiography probe may have contributed to this also. After intraoperative banding, the patient was stabilized and surgery proceeded uneventfully. The patient had no long-term sequelae. Anesthesiologists involved in the care of patients with end-stage liver disease should be aware of this infrequent intraoperative complication and be prepared to treat it appropriately."
20655283,Retinopathy associated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C.,"Retinopathy is associated with the use of interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Common ocular complications include cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, and macular edema.
A 53-year-old black man with a history of drug and alcohol abuse was admitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs clinic for substance abuse treatment. Results of a liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis C, and treatment with interferon and ribavirin was initiated. A comprehensive eye examination was performed just before the initiation of treatment, and the patient was then periodically monitored for the presence of retinopathy. No retinopathy was found at the initial visit or at his 1-month or 2-month follow-up examinations. His 4-month retinal evaluation found cotton wool spots in both eyes and retinal hemorrhages in the left eye. The retinopathy persisted for several months but resolved in both eyes before his treatment was discontinued. Throughout his treatment period there were no visual complaints or visual acuity changes.
Although this patient was visually asymptomatic, and his retinopathy resolved during treatment, we chose to monitor the patient monthly during treatment because of the risk of serious (although rare) ocular complications."
20426917,Spontaneous rupture of giant hepatic hemangioma: a rare source of hemoperitoneum. Case report.,"Hemoperitoneum due to spontaneous rupture of a hepatic hemangioma is a rare and serious clinical event with a high mortality rate.
25-year-old woman under hormonal treatment for pregnancy with abdominal pain with distension followed by vomits, palpable epigastric mass and paleness of the skin and mucosas. Computed tomography of the abdomen without oral and venous contrast showed a heterogeneous and capsulated tumor of the liver. Exploratory laparotomy was carried out that revealed a large tumor occupying the gastro-hepatic site with partial rupture of the tumor's capsule with bleeding. Because of the close relationship between the tumor and the retro-hepatic inferior vena cava, the partial resection of the tumor was realized. The patient had a good post-operative evolution. The study of the tumor revealed hepatic hemangioma.
Hepatic Hemangiomas may evolve to spontaneous rupture leading to hemorrhagic acute abdomen. Surgery is mandatory and the resection of the Hemangioma will depend on the clinical condition of the patient and on the relationship of the tumor with the vascular structures of the liver. Partial resection is a safe choice that saves lives in urgency situations, as the one described herein."
20417503,Norethisterone-induced hepatic adenomas can cause life-threatening bleeding in girls with inherited platelet disorders.,"To describe four cases of hepatic adenoma in adolescents and women with severe inherited bleeding disorders treated with norethisterone.
Case reports.
Necker-Enfants Malades University Hospital, Paris, Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Gynecology and Diabetes.
Two adolescents and two young women with inherited platelet disorders, treated with high-dose norethisterone (10 to 20 mg/day) to induce amenorrhea.
Immediate cessation of norethisterone.
Spontaneous regression of hepatic adenoma.
In four patients with inherited platelet disorders, hepatic adenoma developed at 14, 18, 22, and 24 years of age, respectively, during continuous norethisterone therapy started at 1.5, 2.5, 10.0, and 13.0 years of age, respectively. Life-threatening bleeding occurred in two patients. Immediate norethisterone discontinuation was followed by complete or nearly complete tumor regression within a few months.
Our four cases strongly support a causal link between norethisterone treatment and hepatic adenoma. Continuous high-dose (10 to 20 mg/day) continuous norethisterone to treat menorrhagia in adolescents and young women with bleeding disorders is inadvisable. If other nortestosterone derivatives are needed, the patient should be closely monitored for the development of hepatic adenoma."
17665620,"[Hepatocellular adenoma, a tumour particularly seen in mostly young women].","A 37-year-old woman was examined because of temporary diarrhoea. On CT scan, there was an abnormality of the liver. MRI showed a tumour that was suspicious for adenoma. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma. The patient then discontinued the use of oral contraceptives. The tumour regressed and was resected after two years. A 22-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain. A tumour was found in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. In the laboratory, liver function tests were abnormal. Ultrasound and a CT scan of the liver showed an adenoma. After withdrawal of oral contraceptives, abdominal complaints lessened, but no regression of the tumour was detected. Surgical resection was uncomplicated. Hepatocellular adenoma is a rare, benign tumour of the liver, most often seen in young healthy women. Its incidence is rising due to the prolonged use of oral contraceptives. Not rarely, benign liver tumours are incidental findings on echography. If symptomatic, the presentation usually consists of vague abdominal complaints. Spontaneous rupture and malignant degeneration have been reported for adenoma. A reliable diagnosis is mandatory for the decision whether to apply surgery or continue observation. Radiological investigations play a key role in the detection and diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma. Due to the risk of bleeding and malignant degeneration, elective surgical resection is indicated in symptomatic adenomas, asymptomatic adenomas larger than 5 cm in diameter, and smaller adenomas without regression after discontinuation of oral contraceptives."
17223498,Prevention and treatment of infections in patients with cirrhosis.,"Patients with cirrhosis have altered immune defenses and are considered immunocompromised individuals. Changes in gut motility, mucosal defense and microflora allow for translocation of enteric bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes and the blood stream. Additionally, the cirrhotic liver is ineffective at clearing bacteria and associated endotoxins from the blood thus allowing for seeding of the sterile peritoneal fluid. Thus, hospitalised cirrhotic patients, particularly those with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, are at high risk of developing bacterial infections, the most common being spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and the fact that half of the cases are community acquired, all hospitalised cirrhotic patients should have a diagnostic paracentesis to exclude infection. Those admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and a negative paracentesis require short-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin. A third generation cephalosporin is the treatment of choice for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and, once the acute infection is resolved, secondary prophylaxis with oral norfloxacin is warranted. Patients who develop renal dysfunction at the time of active infection have the highest mortality and require adjunctive albumin therapy. This article reviews the pathogenesis of SBP, the evidence behind the antibiotics used, the rationale for adjunctive albumin therapy in the setting of acute renal failure, and the role of prophylactic antibiotics in specific high-risk populations."
17030175,Norfloxacin vs ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage.,"Oral norfloxacin is the standard of therapy in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, during the last years, the epidemiology of bacterial infections in cirrhosis has changed, with a higher incidence of infections caused by quinolone-resistant bacteria. This randomized controlled trial was aimed to compare oral norfloxacin vs intravenous ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of bacterial infection in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.
One hundred eleven patients with advanced cirrhosis (at least 2 of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy, or bilirubin >3 mg/dL) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were randomly treated with oral norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily; n = 57) or intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g/day; n = 54) for 7 days. The end point of the trial was the prevention of bacterial infections within 10 days after inclusion.
Clinical data were comparable between groups. The probability of developing proved or possible infections, proved infections, and spontaneous bacteremia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was significantly higher in patients receiving norfloxacin (33% vs 11%, P = .003; 26% vs 11%, P = .03; and 12% vs 2%, P = .03, respectively). The type of antibiotic used (norfloxacin), transfusion requirements at inclusion, and failure to control bleeding were independent predictors of infection. Seven gram-negative bacilli were isolated in the norfloxacin group, and 6 were quinolone resistant. Non-enterococcal streptococci were only isolated in the norfloxacin group. No difference in hospital mortality was observed between groups.
Intravenous ceftriaxone is more effective than oral norfloxacin in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage."

We report here spontaneous liver haemorrhage caused by peliosis hepatis, occuring in a 47-year old patient. She used oral contraceptives for many years. A computerized tomography and a magnetic resonance of the abdomen revealed a subcapsular liver hematoma without hemoperitoneum. Treatment consisted of supportive care with favourable clinical outcome. This observation point out a severe complication of peliosis hepatis. The authors review the etiology, diagnosis, complications, treatment and potential role of estrogen/progesterone supplementation as an etiological factor, in peliosis hepatis."
15112762,[Liver hemangioma: the need for a well-defined differential diagnosis and the therapeutical timing dilemma].,"Liver is frequently affected by hemangiomas originated during the embryonal period from defects in the maturation of the endothelia of the capillary system. These benign tumors may result asymptomatic for the whole life (4-7% of incidental autoptical reports), but in some cases they are liable to a spontaneous or traumatic rupture, with haemorrhagic complications which make an urgent laparotomy necessary. The rupture may be caused by different reasons, such as the critical size reached by the endothelia, the development of the mass due to the continuous pulsatility or the hormonal stimuli (puberty, pregnancy or oral contraceptives)."
15049112,[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis].,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurs in 30% of patients with ascites due to cirrhosis leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. The pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is related to altered host defenses observed in end-stage liver disease, overgrowth of microorganisms, and bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to mesenteric lymph nodes. Clinical manifestations vary from severe to slight or absent, demanding analysis of the ascitic fluid. The diagnosis is confirmed by a number of neutrophils over 250/mm3 associated or not to bacterial growth in culture of an ascites sample. Enterobacteriae prevail and Escherichia coli has been the most frequent bacterium reported. Mortality rates decreased markedly in the last two decades due to early diagnosis and prompt antibiotic treatment. Third generation intravenous cephalosporins are effective in 70% to 95% of the cases. Recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is common and can be prevented by the continuous use of oral norfloxacin. The development of bacterial resistance demands the search for new options in the prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; probiotics are a promising new approach, but deserve further evaluation. Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis and ascites shortly after an acute episode of gastrointestinal bleeding."
14614353,Profound imbalance of pro-fibrinolytic and anti-fibrinolytic factors (tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1) and severe bleeding diathesis in a patient with cirrhosis: correction by liver transplantation.,"A 49-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis suffered several spontaneous, life-threatening, deep muscle bleeding episodes. Laboratory evaluation indicated excessive fibrinolysis with low plasminogen, low alpha2-antiplasmin, undetectable plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, high tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity and high t-PA antigen. Treatment with oral anti-fibrinolytic agents prevented further bleeding episodes. Decompensated cirrhosis eventually necessitated orthotopic liver transplantation. Post-operatively, the patient did not require oral anti-fibrinolytic agents, and there were no significant bleeding events. Circulating PAI-1 activity, t-PA activity and antigen normalized by 3 months post transplant. In short, the profound bleeding diathesis, as well as the imbalance in t-PA and PAI-1 levels, corrected after liver transplantation. Recognition of such patients is important, because the bleeding diathesis is an indication rather than a contraindication for orthotopic liver transplantation."
11715625,[Spontaneous bleeding of focal nodular hyperplasia as a rare cause of acute abdomen].,"Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign tumor of the liver. It is most frequently found in women of reproductive age. An association with oral contraceptives and sexual hormones is therefore possible. FNH lesions are frequently discovered incidentally. Spontaneous complications are rare. When the diagnosis is known with reasonable accuracy, a nonoperative approach is in common use. We report here the rare case of spontaneous intraabdominal bleeding from FNH."
10732380,[A new case of hepatic adenomatosis. A critical review of the literature].,"Liver adenomatosis is a rare disease--only 22 cases are previously described--characterized by multiple adenomas (more than ten) in a normal parenchyma. After a literature review the authors cannot exclude a link between the estroprogestatives use and the development of adenomatosis. Most important risks are bleeding and development of new adenomas, after the operation. On the basis of an extensive literature review, diagnosis features, treatment and follow-up are discussed. The aim of this report is to describe a case of multiple adenomas in a 38 years old housewife treated for seven years with oral contraceptives, admitted to hospital for spontaneous subcapsular haemorrhage due to rupture of adenomas, macroscopically considered suggestive of angiomas during the operation. Right lobectomy was performed and microscopic examination diagnosed multiple adenomas (liver adenomatosis). A repeated CT scan eight months later showed more than three new nodules in the liver. A new right lobectomy and tumorectomy of the nodules in III liver segment (remained after the first operation for the erroneous diagnosis) was performed and over a period of 20 months the patient remains in excellent condition."
9860409,Parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis of bacterial infections does not improve cost-efficacy of oral norfloxacin in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin is useful in the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. However, bleeding cirrhotic patients with ascites, encephalopathy, or shock are at high risk to develop bacterial infections in spite of prophylactic norfloxacin. The aim of this study was to assess whether the addition of intravenous ceftriaxone could improve the efficacy of prophylaxis with norfloxacin in these patients.
Fifty-six cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and ascites, encephalopathy, or shock were randomized into two groups: Group 1 (n = 28) received oral norfloxacin 400 mg/12 h for 7 days, and group 2 (n = 28) received norfloxacin plus intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily during the first 3 days of admission.
Ten patients were excluded because of community-acquired infection, surgery, or death within the first 24 h. The incidence of bacterial infections during hospitalization was 18.1% in group 1 and 12.5% in group 2 (p = NS). The incidence of severe infections (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacteremia, or pneumonia) was also similar in both groups: 9% in group 1 versus 8.3% in group 2 (p = NS). There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to duration of hospitalization or mortality. The cost of antibiotic therapy (including prophylaxis and treatment of infections) was significantly higher in group 2.
These results suggest that the addition of intravenous ceftriaxone during the first 3 days of hospitalization does not improve the cost-efficacy of oral norfloxacin in the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and high risk of infection."
9647029,The effect of ciprofloxacin in the prevention of bacterial infection in patients with cirrhosis after upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding are prone to bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic intestinal decontamination with oral ciprofloxacin for the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
A total of 120 cirrhotic patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding were enrolled. Sixty patients received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily given orally or through nasogastric tube immediately after upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination; drug administration continued for 7 days. The remaining 60 patients, who received placebo, served as controls.
The incidence of proven bacterial infection in the ciprofloxacin-treated group was significantly lower than that of placebo group (10% vs 45%, p < 0.001). The incidences of bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and urinary tract infection in the ciprofloxacin-treated group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (0% vs 23%, 3.3% vs 13%, and 5% vs 18%, respectively; p < 0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a lack of prophylactic treatment with ciprofloxacin and severity of cirrhosis were the independent significant predictors for cirrhotic patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding with infection.
Prophylactic intestinal decontamination with oral ciprofloxacin is effective in the prevention of bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis who were suffering from acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage."
9496518,Hemorrhage caused by ruptured liver cell adenoma following long-term oral contraceptives: a case report.,"A 41-year-old woman who had taken oral contraceptives for 14 years was admitted to the hospital with pain in the left shoulder region and epigastrium arising after regurgitation. Sonography and CT revealed a ruptured liver tumor with sealed-off liver hemorrhage. The resected specimen revealed a ruptured and partially necrotic liver cell adenoma. This paradigmatic case illustrates a rare but well known entity: liver cell adenomas prone to necrosis and hemorrhage, requiring emergency intervention, in women on long-term oral contraceptive therapy.
Over 70% of women with liver cell adenomas are oral contraceptive (OC) users, with an average duration of OC use of 5-10 years. In these women, liver cell adenomas are prone to necrosis and hemorrhage. This paper presents the case of a 41-year-old Austrian woman who presented with an intrahepatic and subcapsular hematoma, with a focal capsular tear sealed off by a clot and the diaphragm. Histology revealed a 4.5 cm, partially necrotic liver cell adenoma. The woman had been taking OCs for 14 years. Young OC users with epigastric disorders should be evaluated routinely by ultrasound for liver lesions and resection of liver lesions should be considered to control hemorrhage."
9408705,The contraceptive choice for a Wilson's disease patient with chronic liver disease.,"Preserved fertility status is frequently encountered in patients with Wilson's disease, and contraceptive counseling may, therefore, be a relevant issue. Yet, several contraceptive methods can adversely influence the hepatic function, and the efficacy of others may be affected by the liver disease. We describe a patient with Wilson's disease manifested by cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and bleeding esophageal varices who underwent termination of pregnancy at 9 weeks' gestation. Following the procedure, contraceptive advice was sought in order to postpone conception until portal hypertension was controlled and hepatic function improved. Intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was administered and tolerated well by the patient. A detailed discussion of the contraceptive options for patients with chronic liver disease, in general, and Wilson's disease, in particular, follows the case report.
Although the fertility status of women with Wilson's disease may be preserved, contraceptive method choice is complicated by the tendency for some methods to have an adverse effect on hepatic function and, conversely, for liver disease to compromise the efficacy of some contraceptives. This paper presents the case of a 28-year-old woman diagnosed with Wilson's disease at 13 years of age. She presented to an Israeli hospital at 9 weeks' gestational age with bleeding esophageal varices, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. Although the patient had been oligomenorrheic, with menses every 2-3 months, she had experienced 3 spontaneous first-trimester abortions. Due to the urgent need for a portal decompression shunt procedure and the risk of further bleeding, the patient opted to terminate the current pregnancy. To prevent conception until the patient's liver condition stabilized, she was injected with Depo-Provera and penicillamine treatment was resumed. Although IUDs and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are relatively contraindicated in women with liver dysfunction, spermicide and barrier contraceptives are highly recommended and progesterone-only preparations can be safely prescribed."
9308125,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is considered a bacterial infection of ascitic fluid without any intraabdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. Multiple variants of this infection with a different clinical setting and outcome have been described during the past decade. Bacterial translocation from the gut to mesenteric lymph nodes, depressed activity of the reticuloendothelial phagocytic system and decreased antimicrobial capacity of ascitic fluid seem to be the main steps in the pathogenesis of ascitic fluid infection. Diagnosis of ascitic fluid infection is based on clinical suspicion and analysis of ascitic fluid, especially white cell count and culture in blood culture bottles. A low threshold for performing an abdominal paracentesis is the key for an early diagnosis and treatment. A third-generation cephalosporin is the treatment of choice, achieving a cure rate higher than 80%. Nonazotemic patients with nonadvanced, uncomplicated SBP may be treated with oral ofloxacin. Prophylactic selective intestinal decontamination with oral norfloxacin is extremely useful in preventing SBP in patients that are at high risk for developing SBP, such as hospitalized cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage or low ascitic fluid total protein. Primary or secondary long-term prophylaxis of SBP also decreases the incidence of SBP, but these patients should be carefully observed for detecting possible infections caused by quinolone-resistant organisms. Since long-term prognosis of SBP patients is poor, survivors should be considered for liver transplantation."
8682472,Hepatic adenoma: an observation from asymptomatic stage to rupture.,"A 39 year old female, who took oral contraceptives for about ten years, was found to have an asymptomatic hepatic adenoma during an episode of acute hyperlipidemic pancreatitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by sonography, CT scan, angiography, and liver biopsy. She refused operation and was followed at the outpatient clinic. Initially, the tumor decreased its size after withdrawal of oral contraceptives, but enlarged again on subsequent examinations. She came back to emergency room with hemoperitoneum and intratumoral hemorrhage eighteen months after the initial diagnosis. Her hepatic adenoma was removed surgically and was found to be ruptured. She has been well for two years."
7843826,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in liver cirrhosis: treatment and prophylaxis.,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in liver cirrhosis is due to the passage of intestinal bacteria into intestinal lymph vessels, systemic circulation and ascitic fluid. It may occur in patients with severe portal hypertension and hepatic failure, impaired reticuloendothelial phagocytic activity and low ascitic fluid opsonic activity. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a monomicrobial infection usually caused by gram-negative bacteria. The treatment of choice of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is cefotaxime. Several subgroups of cirrhotic patients have been shown to be predisposed to develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, including cases with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, patients with high serum bilirubin and low ascitic fluid protein concentration (< 1 g/dl), and patients who had recovered from an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Since spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with a relatively high in-hospital mortality rate (20-40%), prophylactic measures to prevent this infection are required. Short-term and long-term selective intestinal decontamination with oral norfloxacin has proved highly effective in preventing bacterial infection and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in bleeding cirrhotic patients as well as recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis."
2179096,A controlled trial of oral propranolol compared with injection sclerotherapy for the long-term management of variceal bleeding.,"This trial was carried out to assess the value of propranolol for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis. We also compared propranolol therapy to long-term injection sclerotherapy. One hundred and eight patients, in whom the original variceal hemorrhage stopped spontaneously (before diagnostic endoscopy) and without sclerotherapy or surgical intervention, were included. All were Pugh grade A or B; 55% had alcoholic cirrhosis. Patients were chosen randomly to receive oral propranolol (in a dosage to reduce resting pulse rate by 25%) or to undergo long-term injection sclerotherapy. In both groups, episodes of repeat bleeding that did not stop spontaneously were managed with sclerotherapy. Patients considered to have failed propranolol therapy were treated with long-term sclerotherapy. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 64 mo. In the propranolol group, 28 (54%) of the 52 patients had repeat bleeding from varices with a total of 57 episodes; 14 received long-term sclerotherapy. In the sclerotherapy group, 25 (45%) of the 56 patients had repeat bleeding, with a total of 40 episodes (p less than 0.20). On an intention-to-treat basis, the risk of bleeding expressed per patient-month of follow-up was similar for the two groups, at 0.05 and 0.037, respectively. Survival as assessed by cumulative life analysis was also similar, with 55% and 66% alive at 3 yr (p less than 0.40). Stepwise regression analysis of possible factors predicting further bleeding in patients taking propranolol selected only two variables--the pretreatment pulse rate and the extent of pulse-rate reduction in response to propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2096049,[Therapeutic problems caused by rupture of large hepatic adenoma with central location. Apropos of 3 cases].,"We report three cases of young female patients (26, 30, 36 years) with intraperitoneal hemorrhage associated with a rupture of a liver cell adenoma. Their topography was central or with central extension. Three patients had taken oral contraceptives, for a period of 10 years, before diagnosis in two cases and for only three weeks in the remaining patient. The diagnosis of hemoperitoneum from a liver tumor was established on initial symptoms and ultra sonographic examination. Angiography and CT were the most valuable investigations. The control of hemorrhage was obtained by hepatic artery ligation (2 cases) and angiographic embolization (1 case). We observed one patient with liver adenomatosis, uncommon lesion consisting of numerous adenomas in an otherwise normal hepatic parenchyma. In emergency major hepatic resection for an adenoma, in central localization, is too a high risk procedure for a benign tumor. Control of hemorrhage should be the aim of treatment, best achieved by alternative treatment, such as hepatic artery ligation of angiographic embolization, highly effective in our experience. Resection may be delayed for a residual tumor."
2561631,[Hepatocellular adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia].,"The diagnostic findings of hepatocellular adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia became more frequent in the last years in our as in western experience. The improvement in diagnostic technique, a correct pathological identification and the diffusion of oral contraceptives explain this increase of incidence. In our series were present 11 hepatocellular adenomas and 19 focal nodular hyperplasias: all the HCA cases were radically resected, while only 15 FNH were resected, only two biopsied and two submitted to periodical follow-up. The tendency to spontaneous bleeding and the presence of diagnostic uncertainty versus well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma are mandatory indications for radical resections in all the HCA cases. FNH resection is reserved to symptomatic cases and wide wedge biopsy is at least required in presence of diagnostic doubts: the asymptomatic FNH (""hot spot"" on Tc99m-HIDA scintigraphy) may be followed-up only."
3594592,[Hormonal contraception and its complications].,"A group of 230 women mostly in the 20-30 age range were prescribed the steroid contraceptives Neogest, Norbiogest, Monogest, Non-Ovlon, and Yermonil. 15 women had painful irregular menstruation. 12 women had undergone abortion, and 6 had had a spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester. Neogest, a one-phase preparation, was used by 28 women. There were 4 cases of menstrual disorders (oligomenorrhea) within 2 years of use and the pills were discontinued. There was 1 case of hypomenorrhea and 1 case of pregnancy with eutocia. Norbiogest, a predominantly gestagen-containing sequential, 2-phase preparation was used by 106 women for 1-10 years. 15 complications occurred (14.1%) consisting of hypo-, oligo-, and amenorrhea, menstrual disorders (2 cases), and lower abdominal pain (6 cases). A liver test was positive in 1 woman who used Norbiogest for 4 years. Monogest, a gestagen preparation for continuous use, was used by 20 women with 4 instances of missed menstruation. 1 case of longer amenorrhea and 1 case of irregular bleeding occurred, manifesting mostly as metrorrhagia. Non-Ovlon, a one-phase preparation, was used by 52 women. After 2 years of use, liver tests became positive. The pill was discontinued, and the tests became negative. Yermonil, a one-phase combined product, was used by 24 women without complications, although 2 women decided to quit using it. There were a total of 25 complications in the sample amounting to 10.8%."
3082733,A randomized clinical trial of supplementary parenteral nutrition in jaundiced alcoholic cirrhotic patients.,"Between March 1982 and September 1983, 40 inpatients (25 men and 15 women, mean age 53 years) with alcoholic cirrhosis and total serum bilirubin greater than or equal to 5 mg per dl were studied. Those with hepatocellular carcinoma, renal failure, hyponatremia, septicemia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hepatic coma were excluded. Patients were studied for 28 days. The two groups were offered an oral diet containing 40 kcal per kg per day. Patients in the supplementary parenteral nutrition group received 40 kcal per kg per day and 200 mg nitrogen per kg per day using a central catheter. The major endpoint was total serum bilirubin on Day 28. On admission, serum bilirubin was not significantly different in the two groups: oral group, 12.5 +/- 6.6 mg per dl; supplementary parenteral nutrition group, 12.3 +/- 8.5 mg per dl. On Day 28, serum bilirubin was lower in the supplementary parenteral nutrition group (2.5 +/- 1.4 mg per dl) than in the oral group (4.1 +/- 2.2 mg per dl) (p less than 0.02). Serum bilirubin was also lower in the supplementary parenteral nutrition group than in the oral group on Days 7, 14 and 21 (p less than 0.05). Analysis of covariance, considering serum bilirubin on admission and at randomization and time between admission and randomization, confirmed these results. On Day 28, anthropometric parameters, serum transferrin, prealbumin and retinol-binding protein were higher in the supplementary parenteral nutrition group, but the differences were not significant. Serum albumin was significantly lower in the supplementary parenteral nutrition group. The incidence of encephalopathy and sepsis was not significantly different between the two groups."
3938250,[Contraception in the hypertensive woman using a vaginal ring delivering estradiol and norgestrel].,"A long term prospective study of contraceptive vaginal rings (CVR) that deliver estradiol and D-Norgestrel was conducted in 12 hypertensive women. Blood pressure was measured five times by an oscillometric automatic device during two control cycles, at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 9th to 12th cycle of CVR use, and again after a one month recovery period. No significant change in blood pressure was noted during CVR usage and this method of contraception appeared safe in hypertensive women. Plasma renin substrate and plasma antithrombin III were non affected by the treatment. These observations are in marked contrast with the dramatic increase and decrease in these proteins that are respectively observed during oral estroprogestative contraception; and confirm the utility of a way of hormone administration that bypass the liver. The significant decrease in sex binding protein, HDL cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides that were observed under CVR treatment could be interpreted as reflecting the androgenic potency of D-Norgestrel.
Combined oral contraceptives (OCs) induce elevations of blood pressure and can aggravate preexisting hypertension. They alter lipoprotein metabolism and coagulation factors, increasing vascular risks. Combined OCs are therefore contraindicated for hypertensive women. Intravaginal contraceptive rings releasing 17 beta estradiol and levonorgestrel have the triple advantage of extradigestive administration, use of the natural estrogen estradiol, and continuous and stable hormone release. 12 patients with moderate hypertension were studied to determine whether vaginal rings would be an appropriate contraceptive choice for hypertensive women. 8 of the 12 developed hypertension while using combined OCs. They observed a 6 month wait between termination of OC use and inclusion in the study or initiation of antihypertensive therapy. In 3 cases, blood pressure spontaneously returned to normal. The 9 other patients received an antihypertensive drug during the study. The vaginal rings were left in place for 3 weeks and removed for 1 week to permit withdrawal bleeding. When in place they delivered an average of 293 + or - 54 mcg/day of levonorgestrel and 133 + or - 34 mcg/day of estradiol. Clinical and gynecological examinations and blood pressure measurements were repeated during 2 control cycles before treatment, on the 21st day of cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 of use, and 1 month after termination of use. Blood pressure was measured 5 times by an oscillometric automatic device. Modification of antihypertension treatment was not required in any case. No variation in systolic pressure greater than 5 mm Hg or of diastolic pressure greater than 4 mm Hg was observed. Plasma renin substrate and plasma antithrombin III were not affected by the treatment. Sex binding protein was reduced by 72% on average. The results confirm the utility of a method of hormone administration that bypasses the liver. Highly significant reductions in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides were observed and could be interpreted to reflect the androgenic potency of levonorgestrel. The vaginal ring may become a very interesting contraceptive alternative for hypertensive women."
3008486,Liver tumours associated with contraceptive hormonal treatment.,"This discussion outlines the different liver tumors described in association with the use of oral contraceptives (OCs). The relationship between hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and OC was the first to be demonstrated, and this association now is firmly established. A relationship exists between the duration of intake of OC and the incidence of tumors. Moreover, the potency of the OC prescriptions influences the risk of tumor. In older patients this relationship with the duration of OC intake is less clear, but the frequency of the tumor is higher. Several reports of spontaneous regression of HCA after withdrawal of OC use have been published, but this regression is not always observed. If OC use is continued or the patient becomes pregnant, a greatly increased risk for complications such as bleeding and rupture of the tumor has been observed. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is diagnosed with increasing frequency in both males and females. Most females are using OC when the tumor is diagnosed. FNH also is found in males and in children not using hormonal drugs. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare in the young age group. The association with OC is documented only by case reports, and large series are not published. The claimed transition of FNH or HCA to HCC is not firmly established. The incidence of HCC did not significantly increase after the introduction of OC. The association between the duration of intake of OC and HCA is not found for HCC. Often the fibrolammellar type of HCC is found in OC users. Recently, it was shown that fibrolammellar HCC is the predominant type of HCC in young women, irrespective of the intake of OC."
3873389,"Oral, nonabsorbable antibiotics prevent infection in cirrhotics with gastrointestinal hemorrhage.","To investigate if oral, nonabsorbable antibiotics prevent bacterial infections in cirrhotics with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 140 consecutive patients were randomly allocated into two groups: 68 patients (Group I) were given oral, non absorbable antibiotics (gentamicin + vancomycin + nystatin or neomycin + colistin + nystatin) from the inclusion into the trial up to 48 hr after cessation of the hemorrhage, or until emergency surgery or death in those cases who continued bleeding; and 72 patients (Group II) did not receive oral, nonabsorbable antibiotics. Both groups were similar in relation to clinical and laboratory data and characteristics of the hemorrhage. The incidence of infection was significantly lower in Group I than in Group II (11 patients in Group I and 25 in Group II developed proved infections; p less than 0.025). This difference was due to the fact that spontaneous bacteremia and peritonitis and urinary tract infection caused by enteric bacteria occurred almost exclusively in Group II. Two patients of Group I and 10 of Group II developed spontaneous bacteremia and/or peritonitis caused by enteric bacteria (p less than 0.025). These results indicate that prophylactic administration of oral, nonabsorbable antibiotics markedly reduces the incidence of infections caused by enteric bacteria in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage."

Results of 108 cases surgically treated in the last 5 years].,"This method of treating hemorrhage from ruptured esophageal varices gives excellent results in cases usually reserved for treatment by portocaval shunts, as well as patients with the usual contraindications to shunt operations. If it is possible without transfusion, and with a single assistant, to definitely stop hemorrhage from ruptured esophageal varices in one hour, then the method is of even greater merit, particularly knowing that the thoracotomy used leaves the untouched abdominal cavity accessible to any possible secondary operation due to progression of portal hypertension and/or hepatic insufficiency. At the request of numerous surgeons in France and from abroad, therefore, a demand has been made to manufacture the apparatus used at the present time after its development over 5 years."
7164526,[Peliosis hepatis. A clinical status inventory].,"Peliosis hepatis is a rare condition, recognizable by macroscopical view. It is characterized by multiple blood-filled cystic spaces in the liver parenchyma. According to 49 out of 152 more recent case reports (1951-1981/82) its spontaneous occurrence is frequently associated with malignant and toxic processes. However, in about 70% peliosis may be induced by the action of certain drugs, especially by 17 alpha-alkylated steroids. Usually peliosis is found by chance at autopsy or peritoneoscopy, as the clinical picture does not provide sufficient conclusive criteria to allow a definite diagnosis. The striking macroscopical appearance contrasts to the dispute on the as yet unestablished natural history. As most important complication spontaneous intraabdominal bleeding can occur in occasional cases. On the other hand, the patients predominantly die of their underlying diseases and not of a peliosis hepatis.

7146560,[Spontaneous subcapsular hepatic hematoma].,"A case of subcapsular hematoma in a 31-year old woman who had taken oral contraceptives (OCs) for 10 years is described. The woman presented with a painful hepatomegaly immediately after giving birth to twins. The symptons, diagnostic findings, and laboratory test results are given, and X-ray films are reproduced. The interest of the case lies in the fact that 2 factors hypothetically related to this anomaly were present: continuous ingestion of OCs and pregnancy. The echographic image demonstrated a mass of heterogeneous consistency with an alternating liquid-solid content. The diagnosis was confirmed through an arteriograph that revealed the presence of other lesions. The presence of the subcapsular hematoma was confirmed at laparotomy but no macroscopically responsible lesion was found, causing the surgeon not to take a hepatic biopsy."
6261404,Benign hepatocellular tumors: a regional survey.,"A survey of benign hepatocellular tumors in a metropolitan area included six cases of hepatocellular adenoma, eight of focal nodular hyperplasia, and two of nodular transformation. Two thirds of the adenomas occurred in women using oral contraceptives; two had life-threatening complications. The focal nodular hyperplasias were generally asymptomatic tumors occurring in patients over a wide age range and apparently not related to oral contraceptive use. The two cases of nodular transformation were incidental findings in patients having abdominal surgery. One of them had used oral contraceptives."
6259090,[Management of liver cell adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia].,"Since 1975 six cases with hepatic adenoma (5 females, 1 male) and five cases with focal nodular hyperplasia (3 females, 2 males) have been treated at our hospital. Four of the five women with hepatic adenoma took oral contraceptive pills before the diagnosis was made, only one patient took the pills in the group with focal nodular hyperplasia. Hepatic adenomas were resected electively in three patients; one patient underwent operation because of ruptureed adenoma with intraabdominal hemorrhage. In the other two cases with hepatic adenoma resections were not possible, but both tumors have regressed after the cessation of oral contraceptives. One patient in the group with focal nodular hyperplasia underwent liver resection because of intratumoral hemorrhage with recurrent pain; in the other four cases no treatment was done as symptoms were absent. We recommend elective resection for hepatic adenoma because of the high risk of spontaneous ruptur. Embolization or ligation of the hepatic artery are alternative procedures when resection is not possible and tumors do not regress after the cessation of oral contraceptives. On the other hand a more conservative attitude is suggested for focal nodular hyperplasia because those patients do not frequently bleed; resection is indicated in case of symptoms or growth of tumor."
6104064,Oral-contraceptive-associated liver tumours.,"Having read the Feb. 9 paper by Dr. Neuberger and colleagues, we should like to report another case of hepatic adenoma that underwent spontaneous regression upon discontinuance of oral contraceptives. In November 1976, a 55-year old female who had been on norethynodrel with mestranol (Enovid) 5 mg/day for about 10 years without interruption, presented with an acute abdomen. At laparotomy, an enlarged, diffusely bleeding liver was encountered, and biopsy findings were interpreted as hepatic cell adenoma. This was confirmed by Professor William M. Christopherson, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky. A nuclide scan revealed a large mass in the right lobe of the liver. Hepatic angiography disclosed a 6x8 cm avascular mass. The included figures, computerized tomographic scans of the liver done on November 28, 1977 and December 12, 1979, respectively, exhibit reduction in tumor size. The oral contraceptive was discontinued and the patient has remained well."
378712,Oral contraceptives and neoplasia.,"Some of the available data concerning the suspected association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and the development of cancer is surveyed, and the attempt is made to evaluate possible associations between OCs and human neoplasia in light of pregnancy risk or benefit of oral contraception. The principal investigative methods in humans include various epidemiologic approaches, and the methodologies most often used are case reports (tumor registries), disease rates and trends, case-control studies, and cohort studies. These methods cannot prove a causal relationship between exposure to a possible carcinogen and the occurrence of disease. Consistent positive or negative evidence, confirmed by multiple epidemiologic approaches, can be used to guide physicians and regulatory agencies in formulating policy for the clinical use of OCs. Both the progestogen-only and the combined OCs have been shown to have a protective effect on the development of benign breast disease with this protective effect not appearing until 2 years of use. Long-term combined OC use appears to be related to the development of benign liver neoplasia, and this risk increases with the dose of the steroid and the age of the user. These lesions are quite rare but may be life threatening because of potential spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage. Long-term postmenopausal use of estrogens appears to increase significantly the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Estrogens appear to be related to the growth of pre-existing uterine leiomyomas. Endocervical cells under the influence of progestogens may develop adenomatous changes, and these benign changes have on occasion been misinterpreted as carcinoma."
454157,Spontaneous rupture of the liver. A complication of oral anticoagulant therapy.,"Therapeutic doses of oral anticoagulants have been associated with spontaneous hemorrhage and rupture of apparently normal abdominal viscera. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of such rupture involving the liver. The patient had sudden severe epigastric pain and signs of acute abdomen and shock. Discrete microscopic changes in the liver may precede massive hemorrhage."
224197,Role of oral contraceptive agents in the pathogenesis of liver tumors.,"Since the introduction of oral contraceptive steroids in 1960 there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of benign liver tumors. Epidemiologic and other evidence links focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic cell adenoma to the use of these agents. The risk increases with long-term exposure. The majority of patients were less than 35 years old. Most patients were exposed to mestranol (ME) alone or alternately with ethinylestradiol, both synthetic steroidal estrogens. Inability to demethylate ME in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes may allow massive accumulation of oncogenic metabolites. This is probably a pharmacogenetic variable in a small number of women. Cholestasis, hypervascularity, induction of intracellular enzyme systems, thrombogenesis, and thickening of arterial and venous walls are other known effects of synthetic estrogens and progestogens. All may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver tumors. Many patients are asymptomatic until there is rapid expansion of the tumor. Pain occurs when Glisson's capsule stretches. Intrahepatic bleeding and liver rupture are common sequelae. Ligation of the hepatic artery may be lifesaving in the face of exsanguinating liver bleeding. Reports of regression with observation alone are encouraging. Instances of progression of unresected adenomas to rupture during subsequent pregnancy dictate avoidance of sex steroids in patients with hepatic neoplasia. Sonography, computerized axial tomography, radionuclide scans, and selective celiohepatic angiography are useful methods for the diagnosis of liver tumor in the symptomatic patient. There is a primary need to develop biochemical methods for detecting patients at risk for developing liver tumors. Epidemiologic research and central reporting of case histories are needed in the search for common factors."
871619,Recurrent massive haemorrhage from benign hepatic tumours secondary to oral contraceptives.,"Liver cell adenoma as a cause of spontaneous haemoperitoneum has been noted with increasing frequency since Baum's initial report (Baum et al., 1973). The relationship between the use of oral contraceptives and bleeding from a hepatic tumour makes awareness of this condition mandatory for the physician involved in the differential diagnosis of the acute abdomen. The report presented here is that of a woman who, while taking oral contraceptives, subsequently bled from her liver 3 years after an initial hepatic haemorrhage."
991010,Spontaneous rupture of liver in patient on oral contraceptives.,Hemoperitoneum as a result of spontaneous rupture of the liver occurred in a 28-year-old woman who had been takingoral contraceptives for 7 years. The hemorrhage occurred between a benign tumour and the liver and was treated by left hepatic lobectomy. The pathologic aspects of this tumour are discussed and the current literature is reviewed. Conservative excision compatible with hemostasis is the recommended treatment.
182106,Hepatic adenoma. Observations after estrogen withdrawal.,"A case of ruptured, benign hepatic adenoma occurred in a young woman taking oral contraceptives. Our observation of this patient after biopsy and control of hemorrhage is the subject of this report. We support the concept that these tumors may regress or remain dormant after estrogen withdrawal, and question the need for routine resection of benign hepatic adenomas. Further observations of growth patterns after estrogen withdrawal are needed."
934872,[Hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of a benign tumor of the liver in women taking oral contraceptives. 2 cases].,"2 cases of rupture of benign liver tumors in women who had received oral contraceptive (OC) treatment for over 7 years are reported. Although the number of cases of benign liver tumor is very small, it has been increasing in recent years. The role of OCs in determining them is still unproven, and the risk appears to be extremely low (between 1 in 500,000 and 1 in 1,000,000); however, it is possible that favor the growth of preexisting lesions or the occurrence of rupture with hemorrhages. It is concluded that the possibility of such cases must be considered by physicians, and that early detection and surgery are required in order to remove the tumor before its rupture and consequent hemorrhage."
175178,Hepatic changes in young women ingesting contraceptive steroids. Hepatic hemorrhage and primary hepatic tumors.,"Primary hepatic tumors developed in 13 young women who had been ingesting contraceptive steroids. Nine tumors were benign, and four malignant. Six tumors ruptured spontaneously and caused life-threatening hemorrhage. Benign tumors were successfully resected in eight women. One woman died during hepatic resection for malignant hepatoma; in two other cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, tumors were nonresectable. In two patients, the tumor was left in situ after neoplasm had been excluded by biopsy. The increase of such tumors in women of childbearing age warrants the suspicion that these contraceptive steroid hormones play an etiologic role."
1193429,Hepatic adenomas and oral contraceptives.,"Over the past 5 years there has been an increase in the number of reports of patients with hepatic adenomas, and an association has been found between these tumors and the use of oral contraceptives. Up to January 1975 46 patients have been reported with this association. The histology of the tumors varies, with several names having been applied to the variations. Adenoma or focal nodular hyperplasia seem to be the most appropriate terms. Most of the commonly used oral contraceptives have been involved. Usually the use of the contraceptive has been at least 2 years. In 1 case, adenoma was diagnosed 4 years after stopping use of the drug. Symptoms have been abdominal pain and an abdominal mass. The tumor may rupture with hemorrhage into the abdominal cavity creating an emergency. Hepatic arteriography has been used to make an early diagnosis. Biochemical tests remain normal. Needle biopsy is contraindicated; surgery is indicated, however. The lesion may be multiple. Hepatic adenoma should be suspected in any young woman with abdominal pain and enlargement of the liver. Ruptured hepatic adenoma should be considered in acute abdominal emergencies, in young women who are taking oral contraceptives, and in older women taking hormone replacements."
1131000,"Hepatic cell adenomas, spontaneous liver rupture, and oral contraceptives.","During the past decade, an increasing number of hepatic cell adenomas have been reported. Sppntaneous rupture, a life-threatening complication of this rare tumor, has been noted more frequently. Eight patients with hepatic cell adenomas have been treated at our center. Three patients first developed symptoms from hemoperitoneum. Palpable tumors were discovered in three asymptomatic patients during routine examinations. Two patients had upper abdominal pain from intrahepatic hemorrhage. All patients were young women using oral contraceptive agents. Emergent hepatic lobectomy was performed in the three patients with rupture. The other five patients underwent selective angiographic studies, prior to elective liver resections. All survived operation and have done well since. The increased incidence of hepatic cell adenomas may be related to the use of oral contraceptive agents."
